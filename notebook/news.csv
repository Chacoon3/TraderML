VanEck Gold Miners ETF sees 15% surge in late February, with value investors drawn to its lower valuations. Technical signals suggest bull market. Top performing mining stocks show cheaper P/E ratios than S&amp;P 500 and semiconductor industry.","If someone were to tell you that NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its peers, as represented by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), didn t lead the pack in the first week of March, you might find it hard to believe. However, an old-economy industry, far distant from the AI hype, significantly outperformed chipmakers. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed the U.S. Congress regarding the possibility of rate cuts contingent upon sustained declines in inflation, an asset quietly ascended to historic heights: gold. The precious metal surged past $2,160 per troy ounce this week, marking eight consecutive sessions of gains. This significant movement didn t escape the attention of value-oriented investors, who flocked to one of the most affordable equity industries. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), a gauge for the performance of the gold mining industry, saw an impressive surge of 15% since late February, outpacing the rise of the AI-related semiconductor sector during the same period. Chart: Gold Miners Outperformed Semiconductors Since Late February, As Gold Hits Record Highs Amidst growing investor concerns over expensive valuations and the possibility that the stock market has surged too rapidly, the allure of gold miners becomes particularly pronounced due to their comparatively more affordable valuations. Currently, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF boasts a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18x, which is cheaper than the S&amp;P 500 s 21x and the semiconductor industry s 30x. The attractive valuations of gold miners have likely captured the interest of value-seeking investors, who aim to steer clear of sectors that have seen their prices surge beyond analysts  upward revisions of future earnings. Since mid-February, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF has witnessed inflows of over $350 million, effectively reversing the outflows seen earlier this year. If fundamentals offer significant insights, technical signals may further reinforce the onset of a bull market. This week, the gold mining stock gauge surged above both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, with the two now forming a so-called golden cross pattern.

We ve asked a lot of questions: Is it overvalued after a 1,634% rise over the past four years? Can the promise of AI deliver the earnings growth expected of the company? Is its position among the mega-cap stocks truly deserved? The first two questions above will only be answered in hindsight, and the third can only be tackled by comparing Nvidia with a similar-sized company. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for instance. Apple has the larger market cap — $2.61 trillion. Nvidia is not far behind, sitting on a valuation of $2.29 trillion.

When it launched the iPhone in 2007, its market cap was around $62 billion. A decade later it was $556 billion. Nvidia, by comparison, stayed flat throughout this period with a market cap just above $2 billion The following data were compiled by Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning, which he posted on X on Thursday. Here are Bilello s findings: 10 years ago: Apple market cap 47x larger than Nvidia 7 years ago: Apple market cap 13x larger than Nvidia 5 years ago: Apple market cap 9x larger than Nvidia 3 years ago: Apple market cap 7x larger than Nvidia 1 year ago: Apple market cap 4x larger than Nvidia Today: Apple market cap 1.1x larger than Nvidia Take a look at Bilello s chart here: 10 yrs ago: Apple market cap 47x larger than Nvidia7 yrs ago: Apple market cap 13x larger than Nvidia5 yrs ago: Apple market cap 9x larger than Nvidia3 yrs ago: Apple market cap 7x larger than Nvidia1 yr ago: Apple market cap 4x larger than NvidiaToday: Apple market cap 1.1x… pic.twitter.com/dXxi71uQCX&mdash; Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) March 7, 2024 The chart shows in stark detail — something that percentage moves don t often convey in words — just how much growth Nvidia s valuation has gained in just the two months or so of 2024. At the close on Dec. 29, 2023, Nvidia s market cap was $1.22 trillion. The means now, at $2.29 trillion, it s added nearly $1.1 trillion in just 67 days. Apple took four years to add its most recent trillion. Is Nvidia Overvalued? Isn t this bubble territory? Analysts don t think so. Many believe Nvidia warrants this valuation because of its earnings creation and its earnings potential. Two days ago, investor and financial TV host featured the stock on his CNBC program saying that given the company s ability to consistently beat market earnings expectations, its valuation was not excessive. Meanwhile, it s become a favored stock of retail investors according to a recent note from Vanda Research with purchases exceeding $1 billion over a 10-day period, compared to just $500 million of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares. ""Trading is about mood and momentum, and when you think mood and momentum, I don't think I have ever seen a company celebrated as much as Nvidia,"" said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at Stern School of Business, New York University, in an interview on CNBC last week. Damodaran did, however, caution that the pricing may have got a little out of control. We will know with hindsight.

Note the following: The chart shows that gold has broken out to an all time high. The chart shows higher volume.&nbsp;This indicates conviction in the breakout. RSI shown on the chart is at an all time high.&nbsp;This indicates there is high momentum behind the breakout.&nbsp;Breakouts that happen with RSI at all time high tend to lead to big moves in the longer term.&nbsp; However, when RSI is this overbought, it often leads to a short term pullback. In The Arora Report analysis, there is an important message here for prudent investors: Stock market sees clear skies as far as the eye can see. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is near all time high indicating that the speculative juices are running at all time high. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at an all time high and goes up every day indicating that many investors believe artificial intelligence is going to trump everything else.

Who is buying gold at a time when the sentiment is at extreme high?&nbsp;The answer is prudent investors who have studied the history of the markets and know that when sentiment gets this high, it is time to buy protection. Historically when sentiment gets this high, something comes out of the blue that nobody has foreseen to drive the stock market lower. Initial jobless claims came at 217K vs 217K consensus.&nbsp;This indicates that the jobs picture is very strong, especially at the low end.&nbsp; Jobs picture is weak in IT and is likely to get weaker in areas that are being impacted by AI.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

This surge was propelled by reassuring comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential interest rate declines. Addressing the Senate Banking Committee, Powell indicated that the Fed is not too far from being confident enough to cut rates suggesting a growing inclination among policymakers to initiate easing policy this year. Powell s statements injected fresh optimism into the markets, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbing to 18,290, nearing its previous record of 18,333 points achieved just days prior.

The managers, who reaped significant gains from the stock, are now wary of its sustainability. What Happened: The proportion of ESG funds holding Nvidia shares dropped to 15% at the end of December from a high of 20% in the second quarter of 2023, reported Bloomberg. This decline in exposure has raised concerns among ESG fund managers, who had previously outperformed the market by investing heavily in Nvidia. One such manager is Kristofer Barrett, who made Nvidia the largest holding in the Swedbank Robur Technology fund, leading it to become the top-performing ESG fund in 2023. Despite his long-term optimism, Barrett acknowledges that Nvidia s valuation is a concern. ""I'm optimistic in the long run, but recognize that the valuation isn't exactly attractive,"" said Barrett.  There's a realization that this has become a retail stock  And that portends a bubble, potentially.  See Also: Disney CEO Bob Iger Reveals Cancellation Of Several Projects Amid Box Office Slump:  And That s Not Easy Despite the drop in ESG fund exposure, Nvidia s market value rose by 17% in the same period. The company s market value soared by almost 240% last year and is already up by nearly 80% in 2024. None of the 66 analysts tracking Nvidia are advising clients to sell, and 60 recommend buying the shares, according to the report. Why It Matters: The concerns raised by ESG fund managers align with recent warnings about a potential bubble in tech stocks, including Nvidia. Renowned finance professor Jeremy Siegel recently cautioned that the current enthusiasm for tech stocks might be a sign of an impending bubble. However, some experts argue that the current tech rally is not a bubble. Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, pointed out that Nvidia s earnings have surged by over 250% since early 2022, while the company's multiple has only expanded slightly more than 100%. Despite the bubble concerns, prominent hedge fund manager Dan Niles recently disclosed Nvidia as one of his top stock picks for 2024. He believes that the earnings potential of Nvidia and other big tech firms will drive their stock performance in 2024.

This move comes amidst a flurry of activity in the cryptocurrency market, highlighting Ark Invest s tactical adjustments in response to the evolving financial landscape. The Coinbase Trade The firm sold 110,896 Coinbase shares through ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) and Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF). The transaction was valued at $24.03 million. On Tuesday, Coinbase shares closed 5.4% lower at $216.77. Earlier on Monday, Ark Invest s decision to offload nearly $31 million worth of Coinbase shares, as reported by Benzinga, coincided with Bitcoin rallying. Recently, Coinbase has faced challenges, experiencing significant outages amid increased traffic as Bitcoin surpassed $64,000, with users reporting incorrect balances. The NVIDIA Trade Ark Invest has continued its NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), selling spree, on Tuesday it sold 5,835 shares through ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ), ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG) and ARKF. The transaction was worth $5.01 million. For the day, Nvidia shares closed nearly 0.9% higher at $859.64. Wood, renowned for her foresight in innovation markets like artificial intelligence, notably identified NVIDIA Corp s potential in AI ahead of others. However, Ark Innovation ETF, led by Wood, sold its Nvidia position prematurely in January, missing out on substantial price increases. Wood, known for her long-term investment approach, acknowledged the importance of taking profits when stocks surge. The Tesla Trade In contrast to its sales, Ark Invest bolstered its investment in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), underscoring Cathie Wood s belief in Tesla s long-term growth potential. Ark purchased a total of 79,956 Tesla shares through ARKK, ARKQ and ARKW. The transaction amounted to $14.45 million on the day when the Elon Musk-led company s shares closed 3.9% lower at $180.74. This move aligns with Wood s optimistic view on Tesla s future, particularly in the realm of autonomous vehicles, and signals confidence in the electric vehicle leader s market trajectory. The Palantir Trade Also on Tuesday, Ark s trades also included a notable purchase of Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shares, amidst growing interest in the company s data analytics solutions. The firm bought 79,090 Palantir shares worth $1.9 million through ARK Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX). Palantir shares closed nearly 1% lower at $23.81 for the day.

What Happened: Cramer believes AI will be crucial to significant market rallies in the coming years.  This technological revolution is crossing all barriers, even potentially becoming the heart of our national security apparatus,  Cramer said. He suggested that AI could be the key to substantial financial gains over the next half-decade, CNBC reported on Wednesday. Companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which produces graphics chips vital for generative AI, have seen significant growth recently. Cramer highlighted that the computing power required for AI-enabled machines is at the core of the current re-industrial revolution and will boost stocks from various sectors. See Also: Crypto Analyst Sees Dogecoin Reaching Half A Dollar Soon, Says  DOGE Has Plenty More Left In The Tank  According to Cramer, the construction required for new data centers is one reason why stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) are performing well. Power management company Eaton Corporation PLC (NYSE:ETN) and Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), which manages wiring in data centers, are also seeing gains due to increased demand. Cramer also identified companies like Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) and ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), which manage and parse data, as potential beneficiaries of the AI wave. He also pointed out the importance of sustainable power generation utilities like Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) and natural gas companies like Enbridge Inc (NYSE:ENB) in this new tech era.  The AI revolution is already producing some of the most investible themes of all time,  Cramer concluded. Why It Matters: Cramer s forecast comes as AI stocks have been experiencing a boom, with companies like Super Micro Computer joining the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, Cramer has also expressed caution about certain AI stocks, such as Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), which he believes has  gotten too hot . He earlier suggested alternative AI investments such as Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Cadence Design Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CDNS). Meanwhile, Harvard economist Ken Rogoff has warned of a potential AI stock bubble, citing the expectation of AI remaining unregulated as a potential risk.

In a recent conversation on CNBC, Yardeni stressed concerns surrounding tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). His analysis suggests a fragmentation within the ranks of the Magnificent Seven.  I think we are getting some splitting here among the Magnificent Seven, they are not all that magnificent,  he remarked. Exposure To China Yardeni observed that many companies with significant exposure to China are coming to realize that the Chinese economy may be experiencing a slowdown, and consumer purchasing patterns are not what they used to be. Specifically, Apple, which derives 20% of its revenue from China, experienced a 24% drop in its iPhone sales within the country this year. The AI Angle Yardeni also highlighted the evolving narrative around artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on these companies.  Apple hasn t repeated the AI mantra too often,  Yardeni stated. The expert also underscored Apple s retreat from the self-driving car market. Conversely, the anticipation around Nvidia Corp. s (NASDAQ:NVDA) upcoming convention in San Jose, CA, presents a buoyant outlook for the AI and semiconductor sectors.  I think that will continue to be a positive theme for the technology area and definitely the semiconductor area,  Yardeni asserted, emphasizing the growing divergence within the tech sector, especially among the Magnificent Seven. Irrational Exuberance? Yardeni observed a mix of rational and potentially irrational exuberance among investors.  If we are looking at the 1990s, which was the last time we talked about exuberance, I don t think we are at 1999, just yet,  he noted. This comparison suggests that while there is noticeable exuberance in the market today, Yardeni believes it has not reached the levels of irrational exuberance and speculative investment that characterized the period leading up to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Yardeni also speculated on the Federal Reserve s moves, suggesting,  There is a possibility that the Fed might not lower interest rates at all this year,  a stance backed by his belief that the economy is doing fine with interest rates where they are right now. Yardeni expressed a tempered outlook, neither advocating for unchecked market exuberance nor predicting a downturn.  I am certainly not rooting for an irrational exuberance, I am not rooting for a market melt-up, I m rooting for the S&amp;P 500 trading at 5,400 by the end of the year, not by the middle of the year,  he wrote.

Stock Buying On Hopium Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of&nbsp;Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Powell is giving testimony in front of Congress.&nbsp;Here are the key points Powell will say based on his prepared text: Inflation has eased but remains above the 2% goal. The policy rate is likely at its peak. If the economy evolves as expected, it will be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some time this year.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Pursuing AI chip market and hiring new SVP. Launches new FPGA family.,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AMD) stock traded above 2% on Wednesday despite reports of U.S. sanctions taking a toll on&nbsp;its China ambitions. AMD initially held a smaller portion of the Chinese AI chip market compared to Nvidia, which dominated the space before the imposition of U.S. restrictions in 2022.&nbsp; However, AMD is now pursuing the AI chip market with greater ambition. In December, it unveiled its new MI300 series, aimed at competing with&nbsp;Nvidia Corp s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) processors. The product tailored for China has been dubbed the MI309. The identity of the Chinese client interested in purchasing AMD s AI chips remains unknown, which could affect AMD s ability to obtain a license if it decides to proceed, SCMP&nbsp;reports.&nbsp; Previously, Nvidia voiced a lack of&nbsp;significant impact from&nbsp;the China ban despite U.S. chipmakers canvassed the U.S. government to go softer on the ban. Major Chinese technology firms, including&nbsp;Tencent Holdings Ltd&nbsp;(OTC:TCEHY) and&nbsp;Baidu Inc&nbsp;(NASDAQ:BIDU), have reportedly accumulated sufficient stockpiles of advanced chips from Nvidia—now under U.S. restrictions—to support their chatbot developments for an additional one to two years. In response to the U.S. ban,&nbsp;Huawei Technologies, based in Shenzhen, is working on developing its AI semiconductors and chip-manufacturing capabilities. The U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed export restrictions on advanced AI processors. To serve its customers in China, AMD designed a chip that aligns with U.S. export regulations, possessing lower performance capabilities compared to its global offerings. AMD also tapped Thomas Zacharia as the new&nbsp;Senior Vice President&nbsp;of Strategic Technology Partnerships and Public Policy. Zacharia will help to drive the global expansion of AMD s relationships with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other entities.&nbsp; His role focuses on accelerating the adoption of customized AMD-powered AI solutions for various global projects aiming to utilize AI for public benefit.&nbsp; Zacharia previously served as the Director of the U.S. s largest multi-program science and energy research laboratory.&nbsp; Meanwhile, AMD launched its latest Spartan UltraScale+ FPGA family, broadening its diverse range of cost-optimized FPGAs and&nbsp;adaptive SoCs on Tuesday.&nbsp; These new devices are designed for various I/O-intensive applications at the edge, showcasing the best I/O to logic cell ratio among FPGAs made with 28nm and finer process technologies.&nbsp; They achieve up to 30% less total power consumption than prior models and feature the most comprehensive security capabilities in the AMD Cost-Optimized Portfolio. Investors can gain exposure to AMD via&nbsp;AOT Growth And Innovation ETF&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AOTG) and&nbsp;Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF&nbsp;(NASDAQ:SOXQ).

(NASDAQ:NVDA) and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)   two AI-focused tech stocks bucked the downtrend. This begs the question whether these stocks are assuming the traits of safe havens? What Is Safe Haven Asset: Safe havens are those assets that retain their value or grow in value during economic downturns due to their lack of, or loose correlation with the overall economy. Bonds, gold, the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and the Swiss franc are typical safe haven bets. Gold, for one, has been considered a store of value. Given its limited supply, it is often considered a hedge against inflation and an asset whose value is less likely to fluctuate with the vagaries of the economy. Similarly, bonds, with their steady returns in the form of interest income as well as principal repayment, are less volatile and are often considered risk-free assets. On Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.65% and the Nasdaq 100, an index of 100 biggest non-financial names, ended down a steeper 1.80%. Even as Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft all ended notably lower, Nvidia stood tall and towering amid the ruins. The Santa Clara, California-based company s stock added 0.86% on Tuesday before ending at $859.64. Smaller AI plays Super Micro gained 1.53% to $1,090.82, tacking on to its 18.7% surge on Monday in reaction to the news of its S&amp;P 500 inclusion.

See Also: Best Tech Stocks Right Now Nvidia, Super Micro   Picks Among AI Plays? Nvidia s visionary leader Jensen Huang spotted the opportunity early on, giving the company a head start in the AI race. Following the unveiling of ChatGPT demand for AI accelerators meant for training and inferencing for generative AI rose exponentially, benefiting Nvidia, which has a full-suite of products for the purpose. The results were there for everyone to see as the company reported back-to-back earnings and revenue outperformances. Following another blowout quarter from Nvidia last month, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said,  The shift to accelerated compute away from general compute is reaching a tipping point, and a disruptive new app, generative AI, is creating a whole new industry.  Some of Nvidia s customers, mainly the biggies, have embarked on making in-house AI chips. The efforts are a long shot, and the viability of going downstream is also a moot point. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer designs and manufactures high-performance server and storage solutions for demanding computational tasks. Notably, 71% of its revenue comes from the U.S., with Asia, Europe, and Others contributing 18%, 8%, and 3%, respectively. The overbought levels of these two stocks could serve as pushbacks for investors. Going by comments from tech analysts, the AI revolution is just getting started and it has several legs to play out. Deepwater Asset Management s Gene Munster conceded that we are in an AI bubble but he expects the bubble to last at least for the next three to five years. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note released on Tuesday that he expects the tech bull run to continue this year.  This is a 1995 Moment as now the AI Revolution and $1 trillion of incremental spending over the next decade is hitting the software ecosystem and rest of tech sector,  he said. In premarket trading, Nvidia climbed 1.61% to $873.51 and Super Micro Computer gained 2.82% to $1,121.54, according to Benzinga Pro data.

TrueMark makes case for actively managed ETFs focusing on concentrated portfolios.,"The debate over active and passive management strategies has weathered the test of time. The passive approach, typified by following broad market indices like the S&amp;P 500, has its advocates, especially given its cost efficiency and simplicity. However, there s a growing interest in the potential of actively managed funds to outperform the market. Despite the skepticism often surrounding active management—fueled by studies like the one from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which highlighted that more than 92% of U.S. large-cap funds failed to beat the S&amp;P 500 over a 15-year period — TrueMark Investment is making a compelling case for its model. The investment firm offers actively managed ETFs, branded as Trueshares, focusing on sectors of the modern economy where they believe a manager s in-depth knowledge can significantly benefit investors. In an exclusive chat with Benzinga, TrueMark Investment s CEO Michael Loukas highlighted that their ETFs are  subadvised.  This partnership model allows TrueMark to tap into the expertise of industry experts to manage the portfolios. By delving into the nuances of a category, they aim to deliver superior returns, or  alpha , to investors.  You Can t Outperform The Market If You Own The Market  A foundational belief at TrueMark is that genuine market outperformance requires a departure from the market s broad composition.  You can t outperform the market if you own the market,  Loukas asserted. This philosophy is channelled through the firm s strategy of maintaining high-conviction, concentrated portfolios. A prime example is the TrueShares Technology, AI &amp; Deep Learning ETF (NYSE:LRNZ), which contains only 21 carefully selected stocks within the artificial intelligence industry. The rationale behind such a concentrated approach is that it embodies the depth of conviction typically seen in institutional investment vehicles like hedge funds.  High conviction is essential, especially in sectors where we see a  winner takes all  dynamic,  Loukas affirmed. In these scenarios, TrueMark s strategy involves investing in a few companies poised to dominate their segment, considered as the  category killers , and then capitalizing on the  lead horses  to drive returns.  We do own NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), but we don t own all the mega caps,  Loukas said regarding the composition of the TrueShares Technology, AI &amp; Deep Learning ETF. Loukas highlighted the tech sector s immense potential and the importance of discernment in selecting investments.  While the benefits of AI are widespread, a strong business model is crucial for an investment to be sound,  he said. Top-Performing AI-Related Exchange Traded Funds In the realm of AI-related ETFs, TrueMark s offering has distinguished itself with outstanding returns. Over the past six months, the TrueShares Technology, AI &amp; Deep Learning ETF secured a second place in its category, delivering a robust 20.6% return since early October. This performance places it just behind the Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF (NYSE:CHAT), which led with a 22% increase.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) fails have been rare since the company introduced the iPhone in 2007, but the recent abandonment of its decade of research and investment in an autonomous car was a black-eye for the company. Meanwhile, its latest launch, the Vision Pro, a  spatial computing  virtual reality and video headset, has met with mixed reviews and has a $3,499 starting price.  With a dearth of impactful applications beyond watching movies, Vision Pro clearly needs vastly improved price/performance for bull arguments for disruptive upside opportunity to be credible,  said Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett. What Apple needs, the analyst added, if it is to maintain its position alongside other Magnificent Seven stocks such as Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is to step up its artificial intelligence offerings. Also Read: Altman s Hunt For OpenAI Capital, Sparking Talks With Temasek Apple Shares Move South Apple shares are down 11.5% year-to-date. It is no longer the world s biggest company. Its market cap is still astonishingly large at $2.63 trillion, but it has fallen below Microsoft, which is close to $3 trillion. By contrast, Amazon shares are up 14.8% so far this year, while Microsoft is 7.3% higher. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is up 38.3% and NVDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the supplier of AI-powering processing units, is up 70.5% already.  If Apple can launch inspiring new AI capabilities, that could go some way to easing the current funk,  said Crockett. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the company s December earnings report that the company expected  breakthrough potential for generative AI,  adding that it was currently investing significantly in this area. But it spends less, said Crockett. According to the analyst s data, Meta spent $38 billion in AI R&amp;D last year and said it expected to spend $30-$37 billion in 2024, while Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) spent $45 billion last year, compared with Apple s $30 billion. He added:  The portion of R&amp;D and capex spend on AI is also probably much larger at Alphabet and Meta than Apple.  Given its lesser investments, we suspect Apple will be hard-pressed to compete with Microsoft and Google in AI subscriptions and large language models.  Crockett concluded that Apple s main value from AI was in boosting sales of iPhones and Mac Air laptops. Rosenblatt retained a Neutral rating on Apple stock and a $189 price target.

The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that executives at Temasek — one of the world s largest state-owned investors — have had several rounds of discussions with OpenAI s CEO Sam Altman in recent months. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, the FT said Temasek, which has an asset portfolio worth $287 billion, was initially interested in investing in Hydrazine Capital, Altman s venture capital fund, but recent talks included the possibility of investing in OpenAI. Benzinga contacted both Temasek and OpenAI for comment. Temasek replied saying that  as a matter of policy, we decline to comment on market speculation.  OpenAI Chip Manufacturing Project If true, the talks come as Altman seeks funds to contribute to the global semiconductor manufacturing output. To this end, he has already been in talks with Middle East sovereign wealth funds, as reported last month by Benzinga. The ambitious project proposed by Altman would likely cost in the region of $7 trillion and he is reportedly seeking support from U.S. government officials to boost global chip capacity in anticipation of an expected boom in demand from AI development and deployment. Altman wrote on X last month:  We believe the world needs more AI infrastructure — fab capacity, energy, datacenters, etc — than people are currently planning to build.  Building massive-scale AI infrastructure, and a resilient supply chain, is crucial to economic competitiveness. OpenAI will try to help.  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently OpenAI s biggest investor with around $13 billion of backing. But a number of venture capital groups have invested smaller amounts in the company, including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Also Read: TSMC, Samsung Lead Recovery In Asia s Emerging Markets With AI And Chip Sector Growth OpenAI s Complex Structure Despite, or because of, the scrutiny of global regulators, Microsoft has repeatedly said it has no interest in owning or controlling OpenAI. Yet its large investment ensures Microsoft exclusive license to OpenAI s intellectual property, excluding generative AI (GenAI) deployments the company may eventually make. Thus, what a potentially large investment from a sovereign wealth fund or other state-backed mega-fund might mean for OpenAI s ownership structure remains a mystery. And, while Microsoft s investment entitles it to a share of OpenAI s earnings, the huge revenue growth seen at the company seen since the launch of ChatGPT, still hasn t generated profit due to the massive development costs. This is another reason why the company would like to build a chipmaking infrastructure to become less reliant on expensive processing equipment from companies such as Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose graphics processing units (GPUs) it mainly uses on its large language model systems.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is trading around the 510.95 mark. For bullish investors, an upward movement towards 511.69 is desirable. Should the market maintain its strength above this level, the next objective is to reach the 512.26 support level. Holding at 512.26 could propel the price towards 512.91, with an ultimate bullish target for the day at 513.76. On the downside, if the 510.95 level fails to act as support, the market may see a downward trend towards 510.14, indicating bearish momentum. A further drop below 510.14 could see the price testing the 509.49 mark. A significant sell-off could push the price down to 508.83, with the day s lowest bearish target at 508.34. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ)&nbsp;is hovering around the 441.56 level. Bulls are looking for the price to stay above this point, with 442.53 as the next target for a firm support establishment. If buying persists, the 444.09 level could come into play, potentially leading to a test of 445.09. The highest bullish target set for today is 445.43. Conversely, if the price cannot sustain above 441.56, bears might take over, pushing the price down to 440.78. A further decline could see the price testing the 440.00 level. Persistent selling pressure might drive the price towards 438.89, with the ultimate bearish target for the day at 437.47. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is trading near 171.79. Bulls are eyeing this level as a base for pushing the price to 172.45. A continued upward trend could take the price to 172.95. If bullish momentum is strong, we could see a move towards the day s high bull target at 173.39. Should the 171.79 support level give way, bears might push the price down to 171.13. With increased selling, the next target would be 170.32. A break below this could lead to a test of 169.73, with the lowest bear target at 168.99. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:MSFT) current price is around 413.14. Bulls aim to keep the price above this level, with 414.56 as the next target for establishing support. Sustained buying could lift the price towards 416.32, with an optimistic bull target at 417.25. If the 413.14 support fails, the price might drop to 411.72. A breach of this level could see the bears aiming for 410.64. Continued downward pressure could lead to a test of 409.69, with the bearish target for the day at 408.46. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading close to 846.80. Bulls are pushing for a move up to 852.61, aiming to solidify this as a new support level. Further bullish activity could drive the price towards 858.43. Strong buying could lead to a rally up to 865.62, with the day s high bull target at 877.25. If the 846.80 support level is not maintained, a downward move to 842.42 could be seen. A breakdown below this level could result in a price drop to 837.58. Weak market conditions might lead to a test of 833.50, with the bear target for the day at 827.98. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is currently at 132.84. Bulls are looking to maintain this as the support level, aiming for an increase to 133.78. Continued bullish momentum might lead to a test of the high bull target at 134.96.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has applied export restrictions on high-powered AI processors. AMD, seeking to cater to its Chinese clientele, proposed a chip compliant with U.S. export standards, featuring lower capabilities than those available internationally.&nbsp; However, U.S. authorities deemed the chip excessively advanced, mandating a Bureau of Industry and Security license for its distribution.&nbsp; The U.S. continues to tighten controls over China s procurement of cutting-edge semiconductors and chipmaking equipment, motivated by concerns over potential military enhancements.&nbsp; The Biden administration escalated these measures in 2022 and expanded them in October 2023 to encompass additional technologies and regulate transactions with intermediary countries. AMD has a&nbsp;commanding position in&nbsp;the semiconductor industry with its control over the x86 chip standard. However, its influence faces a challenge from China s strategic shift to the open-source RISC-V architecture. China s adoption of RISC-V, particularly for cloud computing and intelligent vehicles, signals its ambition to bypass U.S. sanctions and lessen its reliance on Western chip technologies, such as AMD s x86.

What Happened: Cramer, in his show  Mad Money,  dismissed the notion of sector bubbles and encouraged investors to be prepared to buy if the market experiences a pullback, reported CNBC on Monday. He mentioned the increasing artificial intelligence (AI) sector and the possible overvaluation of some AI stocks but emphasized that this does not preclude further growth. ""I will be ready to buy if this market sells off,"" he said. ""Just raise some cash and be ready to do some buying if and when the market has its inevitable pullback after this incredible run."" Cramer cited Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an example, indicating that the company s market cap of over $2 trillion is not excessive, and it has consistently surpassed earnings estimates. Cramer also endorsed the high valuations of drug companies like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), which produce GLP-1 medications for diabetes and obesity treatment. See Also: Dogecoin Jumps 15% As Trader Speculates On ETF Odds, Technical Chart Shows Bullish Signals Cramer suggested that the upcoming labor report could potentially trigger a buying opportunity, predicting stronger figures than expected by Wall Street. Why It Matters: Cramer s advice comes amid significant developments in the tech and pharmaceutical industries. Nvidia s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently suggested that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could become a reality within the next five years, depending on how its achievement is defined. With Nvidia at the forefront of producing AI chips, Huang s insights carry significant weight in the tech industry. Meanwhile, the race for new drugs to fight obesity and related diseases has been heating up, with companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk facing new competitors. Positive results from trials by Zealand Pharma have led to a surge in the Danish company s shares, adding to the intense competition in the weight-loss drug market.

(NASDAQ:AMD) has reportedly encountered a significant obstacle in its efforts to sell a specialized artificial intelligence chip to the Chinese market. What Happened: The U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed restrictions on the export of high-powered AI processors.&nbsp; AMD had sought approval from the U.S. government to sell the AI chip to Chinese clients, which was designed to meet U.S. export regulations, as it had lower performance than AMD s chips sold outside China, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.&nbsp; However, U.S. officials have informed AMD that the chip was still too potent, necessitating a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department for its sale, according to the sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; See Also: Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin Admits To Rushing  Messed Up  Gemini Image Generator Without Proper Testing AMD did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments, and it remains unclear whether the company will apply for a license. The U.S. has been actively limiting China s access to advanced semiconductors and chip manufacturing tools, fearing that Beijing could gain a military advantage.&nbsp; The Joe Biden administration introduced initial export controls in 2022, which were further strengthened in October 2023 to include more technologies and restrict sales to intermediary nations. This has led to a series of export restrictions, including the limitation of the sale of powerful AI chips to China, a move that has affected major players like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD. Why It Matters: Despite these restrictions, Chinese companies have reportedly been making strides in advanced chip development.&nbsp; For instance, last month, it was reported that Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), China s largest chipmaker, has managed to produce more sophisticated chips despite U.S. sanctions.&nbsp; Meanwhile, in November 2023, Jensen Huang's Nvidia confirmed its intention to dominate the Chinese chip market, despite increasingly severe export restrictions from the U.S. government.

Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock.&nbsp;The chart of SMCI is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows SMCI stock ran up on its addition to the S&amp;P 500. The chart shows SMCI stock is attempting to break out. The chart shows the huge run up in SMCI stock this year. RSI on the chart shows that SMCI is not overbought, meaning there is more upside potential. SMCI has become a favorite of the momo crowd.&nbsp;The momo crowd incorrectly thinks SMCI has the same potential as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).&nbsp;Investors need to keep in mind the following: SMCI moves a lot more than NVDA.&nbsp;SMCI is so volatile because of the small float. SMCI is an assembler of servers for artificial intelligence. It uses components from NVDA, Micron (MU), and Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL). NVDA has a large moat to protect it that includes IP for its GPUs.&nbsp;SMCI has no moat and the barrier to entry for competitors is low. SMCI sales are to hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).&nbsp;The reason SMCI sales are booming is that they have availability of NVDA chips.&nbsp;As chips become more available to competitors, SMCI will not be able to sustain its sales growth rate. The momo crowd is buying SMCI due to lack of knowledge.&nbsp;However, there are many investors who understand and have the knowledge of SMCI&rsquo;s business.&nbsp;Many such investors are short selling SMCI.&nbsp;For the time being, short sellers are being overwhelmed by the YOLO crowd. Taking all of the above into consideration with the quantitative analysis screen of the ZYX Change Method, in an optimistic case, the fair value of SMCI stock is $442 - $486. SMCI has become a YOLO (you only live once) stock. The YOLO crowd is dreaming of SMCI going to $5,000. Prudent investors need to be mindful that back in 2020 and 2021, many stocks were run up as less informed investors shifted their mindset to YOLO.&nbsp;A vast majority of those stocks lost 90% of their value.&nbsp; In practical terms, YOLO means when investors are willing to bet big on a stock going up, just because it is going up.&nbsp;They bet big without analysis or attention to risk on the theory that there is no need to think of analysis or risk because they are going to live only once so they might as well roll the dice.&nbsp;&nbsp; SMCI is just one example.&nbsp;Similar YOLO buying is beginning to happen in several other stocks. Prudent investors need to remember that after YOLO peaked in 2021, there was a vicious bear market in YOLO stocks in 2022. YOLO is a symptom of sentiment advancing in the extreme positive zone.&nbsp;As we have written before, extreme positive sentiment is a contrary indicator.&nbsp;In plain English, this means that extreme positive sentiment is a sell signal.&nbsp; As we have emphasized before, extreme positive sentiment is not a precise timing signal.&nbsp;Sometimes it leads to a market pullback in due course.&nbsp;Other times, the extreme positive condition gets relieved by sentiment simply turning positive for a period of time without a market drop.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is prudent for investors to be cautious when sentiment turns to extreme positive, with the exception of short term tactical positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a very important stock for the stock market.&nbsp;Of special interest to investors is that lately AAPL stock has not been doing well, but the stock market continues to go higher.&nbsp;Apple has just been fined $2B by the European Union for abusive practices related to music streaming.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

In today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.","Good Morning Traders! In today s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is currently trading around our level of 512.26. For those looking for upward movement, the initial target is 512.91. Should the market maintain strength above this level, the next goal is to reach 513.76, which serves as a key support. Maintaining above 513.76 during the trading session could lead to a further rise towards 514.62. The ultimate bullish target for SPY today is set at 515.68, marking the highest point bulls aim to achieve. On the downside, if the SPY fails to hold 512.26 as support, the bearish outlook becomes more probable. The first level bears will test is 511.69, followed by a potential drop to 510.95 if selling pressure intensifies. A break below this level could see the SPY reaching down to a significant support at 510.14. In the event of a strong bearish push, the lowest target for today is set at 509.49. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), also known as the Q s, is hovering around a pivotal point at 445.09. For a bullish scenario, it s crucial that 445.09 is maintained as a base. If this is achieved, the next objective is to secure 445.43 as a solid support level. With sustained buying, we might see the Q s advancing to 446.51. A robust trading session could potentially lead to testing higher grounds at 447.73, with the highest bullish aim for today being 449.36. Conversely, if the Q s struggle to stay above 445.09, it could signal bearish control. The initial bearish target is 444.09, with further weakness potentially leading to 442.53. Persistent selling might challenge the support at 441.56, and if this level fails, the bearish momentum could extend down to the day s lowest target of 440.78. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is presently positioned around 178.61. For bullish investors, holding 178.61 as a base is crucial. An upward move would ideally lead to 179.36, followed by an ascent to 180.10. Should the bullish sentiment prevail in today s market, the target is to push Apple s stock beyond to a high bull target of 180.60. If Apple s stock cannot sustain 178.61 as a support, a bearish trend might emerge, first testing 178.18. Increased selling pressure could drive the stock down to 177.20, and if the bearish momentum continues, 176.84 could come into play. The lowest bear target set for today in such a scenario is 176.29. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft&nbsp;(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently seen around 413.14. Bulls are hoping for the stock to remain firm above this level and aim for a rise to 414.56, which should be established as a support during the trading hours. A sustained position above this key level could trigger an upward move towards 416.32, with the day s bullish pinnacle being 417.25. Should Microsoft fail to keep 413.14 as its support, the bearish perspective gains ground. The first level to watch is 411.72, with a potential further slide to 410.64 if the bears continue to push. A continued downward trend could see Microsoft reaching 409.69, with the ultimate bear target for today being 408.46. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading near a critical point at 833.50. Bulls are eyeing an upward movement to 837.58, hoping to establish it as a clear support zone. Further bullish endeavors aim to push the stock to 842.42, and with continued buying interest, a surge to 846.80 is anticipated. The highest bullish goal for NVIDIA today is 852.61. On the flip side, if NVIDIA cannot sustain 833.50 as a robust support in today s session, a bearish trend is likely to unfold. The initial bearish marker is set at 827.98, with a break below this level possibly leading to a decline to 823.52. Weakness in today s trading could prompt a test at 816.95, with the lowest bear target being 810.13. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) current trading level is 136.29. Bulls are aiming for 136.94 to act as a foundation, pushing the trading value up to 137.79. Continued bullish force could propel Alphabet towards the high target of 138.39 for the day. If Alphabet cannot maintain 136.29 as a support, bears may drive the price down to 135.66. A breach of this level could lead to further testing at 134.96. In the case of significant selling, the bearish endpoint for today is anticipated to be 133.78. Meta Platforms Inc Meta&nbsp;(NASDAQ:META) is positioned around 500.83. For a bullish outlook, it s essential for the stock to stay strong above this level, with an upward trajectory aiming for 504.54. A solid buying session could elevate the price to 508.25, with the ultimate bullish target for the day being 512.85. Conversely, if Meta cannot hold 500.83 as a base, a bearish perspective might take over, initially targeting 498.03. Continued selling could lower the price to 495.54, and if the downtrend persists, the bearish aim for the day is 492.33. Tesla Inc. Tesla s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is at a crucial juncture of 198.87. Bulls are looking to propel the price to 200.43, with further buying potentially leading to 201.85. A bullish market today could see Tesla reaching higher levels at 204.33, with the day s ultimate bullish goal being 206.71. If Tesla cannot maintain 198.87 as a solid support today, a bearish trend might be indicated, initially targeting 197.50. With continued selling, the price could be driven down to 195.91, and if the bearish momentum is sustained, the day s lowest target is 193.81.

Other top trading members of Congress also bought the stock recently.,"Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi, saw increased attention, recently disclosed the purchase of call options in cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) before and after recent second-quarter financial results. Other members of Congress are also buying shares of the cybersecurity stock. What Happened: According to a disclosure shared by Quiver Quant, Pelosi s purchases were as follows: 50 call options PANW, strike price $200, expiration date Jan. 17, 2025, trade placed on Feb. 12 20 call options PANW, strike price $200, expiration date Jan. 17, 2025, trade placed on Feb. 21 Both trades were disclosed on Feb. 23 by Pelosi. The second transaction happened the day after Palo Alto Networks reported financial results and came as shares fell post-earnings. Data from Quiver Quant shows that several other members of Congress have also been buying shares of the cybersecurity stock in the last several months. Rep. William Keating (D-Mass.): $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock, trade placed Jan. 24 Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.): $50,000 to $100,000 PANW stock, trade placed Dec. 1 Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.): $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock, trade placed Nov. 28 Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.): $15,000 to $50,000 PANW stock, trade placed Sept. 13, $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock, trade placed Oct. 3 Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah): $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock, trade placed Sept. 13 Data from CapitolTrades also shows the following transactions: Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.): $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock on Jan. 10, $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock on Jan. 10 (separate trade), $1,000 to $15,000 PANW stock on Nov. 13 Related Link:&nbsp;10 Best Stock Traders In Congress In 2023 (Spoiler: Nancy Pelosi Has Reentered The Chat) Why It's Important: The trading activity of members of Congress continues to generate headlines and attention from traders, with potential conflicts of interest and trades being done with knowledge not available to the public. Another item that could jump out to investors in regard to the trading disclosure by Pelosi and other recent transactions is a comment from Palo Alto Network's CEO during the recent earnings call. ""The CEO of $PANW recently said that they are hoping for a major government contract,"" Quiver Quant tweeted. Palo Alto Networks saw shares drop after reporting revenue and earnings per share that beat Street consensus estimates, while also reporting guidance that came in weaker than expected. Investors should note that Pelosi was listed as one of the 10 best trading members of Congress in 2023, as tracked by UnusualWhales. Gottheimer and Khana also had some of the most profitable trades during the last year. Gottheimer ranked first, second, third and ninth on the list of the 10 best trades in 2023 with trades connected to the stock of Meta Platforms, Monster Beverage Corporation and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Two trades in Meta and the trade in Monster were each up over 100% in 2023 according to the report. Khanna had the fourth-best trade of the year with a 55.5% gain from a trade-in Nividia Corp. Pelosi has one of the best trades in Nividia in recent months, with a trade made in late 2023 up over $1 million currently for her and her husband. There is no guarantee that any of the members of Congress have any knowledge or information to why Palo Alto Networks shares could be undervalued. The trades could be a bet on growth of the cybersecurity sector. The trades also come as the government has put in effect new regulations on how companies must protect themselves from cybersecurity incidents and disclose attacks after they happen. Leading healthcare company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) recently disclosed a cybersecurity attack made by ransomware group Blackcat on its Change Healthcare unit. The company disclosed that it is working with Alphabet-owned Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks to address the matter. Several analysts lowered their price targets on Palo Alto Networks after second-quarter earnings results and guidance. While following the trades of members of Congress won't always be profitable, seeing a stock that is bought by three of the top names in Congress when it comes to profitable trades should draw the attention of traders. PANW Price Action: Palo Alto Networks shares trade at $302.40 versus a 52-week trading range of $176.30 to $380.84.

	Lenovo’s profit fell 23% in its third fiscal quarter to $340 million 
	The PC maker expects its new AI PC models to fuel its next revenue boom


By Lau Chi Hang","Key Takeaways: Lenovo&rsquo;s profit fell 23% in its third fiscal quarter to $340 million&nbsp; The PC maker expects its new AI PC models to fuel its next revenue boom By Lau Chi Hang Shares of&nbsp;Lenovo Group Ltd.&nbsp;(OTC:LNVGF) (OTC:LNVGY) were under fire last month after it announced its latest results for its third fiscal quarter through December. The stock fell as much as 9.3% at one point in the next trading day, though it later pared some of those losses and ultimately closed down 3.3% at HK$8.55 for the day. Still, the loss made Lenovo a blue-chip dog for the day, behind only local developer Wharf Real Estate (1997.HK). So, why all the jitters? After all, the PC giant pointed out its revenue of $15.7 billion for the three months to December was up sequentially for a third consecutive quarter, while its $337 million profit was up 35% from the previous quarter.&nbsp; But the picture wasn&rsquo;t quite as rosy on a year-over-year basis, with the latest revenue figure up just 3% from the year-ago quarter. Profit looked even worse, falling 23% on a year-on-year basis. Cumulatively, the company&rsquo;s revenue was down 13% year-on-year during the first nine months of its fiscal year, while its profit slumped 49%. Losing Investor Favor The sequential revenue gains over the last three quarters may reflect some improvement in its performance, but Lenovo has yet to convince an analyst community worried about its longer-term prospects. A number of those analysts lowered their price targets for the company anywhere from 4% and 19%. Bank of America made one of the biggest cuts, dropping its target from HK$11.20 to HK$9.10. CLSA cut its target by a smaller amount from HK$10.90 to HK$9.60, but also downgraded the stock from a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; to &ldquo;outperform.&rdquo; UBS maintained a &ldquo;sell&rdquo; rating on the company. The chilly attitude stems from a generally bearish view on Lenovo&rsquo;s server business, which is expected to remain in the red over the coming quarters on heavy spending for new product development. At the same time, no one was too excited about the company&rsquo;s generally weak guidance. But Lenovo still has at least one fan in the analyst community, as HSBC took the contrarian step of raising its target price on the company from HK$11.40 to HK$11.70 and maintained its &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating. HSBC also pointed out that Lenovo&rsquo;s operating margins have beat its own and the market&rsquo;s expectations, and expects the company&rsquo;s global server business to break even in 2025. High Hopes For AI PCs The market may not be bullish on Lenovo&rsquo;s stock over the short-term, but many have higher hopes over the longer term depending on how it progresses in the emerging area of PCs using artificial intelligence, or AI PCs. Excitement about the potential for AI in PCs has powered many related company stocks these days, including a 32% rise for rival&nbsp;Dell&nbsp;(NYSE:DELL) last Friday after the company reported stronger-than-expected server sales due to high demand for its AI-optimized models. The rise of hybrid AI PCs will drive a new wave of demand for PC upgrades, putting sales back on a stronger growth track, said Lenovo Chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing. He added the company expects that more than half of all PCs will be equipped with AI functions by 2026. With so much at stake, Lenovo &ndash; like all of its rivals &ndash; is sparing no expense to strengthen its hand in the upcoming AI era. The company said it plans to boost its investment in product innovation until R&amp;D staff make up more than a quarter of its total employees. It also expects the R&amp;D spending ratio for its current fiscal year to reach a record high. In a conference call with investors following the release of its latest report, executive vice president and Lenovo China President Liu Jun discussed the upcoming launch of two AI PCs in the $1,000 to $1,500 price range at the company&rsquo;s Innovation Technology Conference in April. That means all eyes will turn to the company again next month to see what it has to offer in this critical area. PC Skeptics&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s also no lack of skeptics who doubt whether demand for AI PCs will lead to a sales renaissance for the mature industry. The global PC market is still posting weak growth in the post-Covid period, with data tracking firm IDC forecasting only 3.1% average annual growth through 2027. Put differently, IDC doesn&rsquo;t seem to expect that AI PCs will breathe major new life into overall sales even if they become the next big thing. At the same time, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that Lenovo will profit handsomely from AI PCs, and that the big profits may instead go to other players in its supply chain. A similar case is new energy technology, where lithium suppliers are emerging as some of the biggest winners while manufacturers struggle to stay in business. Similarly, other companies that supply high-tech components for PCs, such as chip manufacturers like&nbsp;Nvidia&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) and&nbsp;AMD&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AMD), could end up the biggest winners in the move to AI PCs. Then there are also rising concerns over whether the U.S might prohibit or limit American companies from selling cutting-edge chips to China, which could set back players from related Chinese industries. The potential for such action surfaced in a Newsweek article a year ago, in which an expert recommended a U.S. ban on the use of Lenovo computers over suspicions the company illegally obtained PC users&rsquo; information. Bloomberg Businessweek later exposed that the organization behind the recommendation, China Tech Threat (CTT), had close relations with Dell, implying the move was an instance of one rival attacking another rather than a case of a real security threat. Still, concerns will inevitably remain. After all, Washington is quite wary of China&rsquo;s rise, taking regular steps to stymie Chinese tech companies in certain areas like AI and cutting-edge microchips. So, Lenovo, as a leader in the industry, could easily fall into Washington&rsquo;s crosshairs. With so many question marks hanging over the company, it&rsquo;s no wonder investors are cautious.&nbsp; This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

Challenges remain in replicating human cognition.","Nvidia Corp s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, suggested at a Stanford University economic forum that&nbsp;artificial general intelligence&nbsp;(AGI) could become a reality within the next five years, depending on how its achievement is defined.&nbsp; With Nvidia at the forefront of producing AI chips, crucial for developing AI systems like OpenAI s ChatGPT, Huang s insights carry significant weight in the tech industry.&nbsp; He proposed that measuring AGI by a computer s ability to pass a comprehensive array of human tests could lead to reaching this milestone relatively soon, Reuters reports. Also Read:&nbsp;Nvidia, Microsoft Back Figure AI with $675M Investment for Humanoid Robots Integration Currently, AI systems can succeed in exams like the legal bar but face challenges in more specialized fields such as gastroenterology. However, Huang is optimistic that AI could also excel in these areas within five years. Despite this optimism, Huang acknowledged that the broader definition of AGI, which encompasses a deeper understanding and replication of human cognitive processes, remains elusive.&nbsp; This complexity is partly because there is still no consensus among scientists on precisely defining the workings of the human mind, making it a more challenging target for engineers who thrive on clear objectives. Regarding the infrastructure required to support the burgeoning AI industry, Huang responded to queries about the necessity for more chip manufacturing facilities.&nbsp; While agreeing on the need for additional fabs, he highlighted simultaneous improvements in chip efficiency and AI processing algorithms.&nbsp; These advancements, he suggested, could amplify computing capabilities by a million times over the next decade, potentially moderating the sheer number of chips needed as each becomes more powerful and efficient.

This comes as internet companies face challenges and China plans subsidies for domestic chip usage.,"In a bid to support its artificial intelligence (AI) startups, China has announced a significant move. The country is offering  computing vouchers  to these companies, aiming to address the challenges posed by the U.S. chip restrictions. What Happened: The Chinese government has taken a proactive step to aid its AI startups, which have been facing a shortage of crucial chips due to U.S. restrictions, the Financial Times reported on Monday. At least 17 city governments, including Shanghai, have promised to provide  computing vouchers  to help these companies deal with the rising costs of data centers. The vouchers, valued at $140,000 to $280,000, can be used to train and operate large language models (LLMs) for AI data center time. This initiative comes as a response to internet companies with cloud computing services canceling contracts due to stricter U.S. controls. This has led them to reserve the majority of AI processors for internal use and important clients. The Biden administration s tightening of China s access to critical AI chips has forced companies to stockpile, repurpose Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) gaming chips, or resort to the black market. See Also: Jim Cramer Says  This Is The Man Who Is Taking AI To The Next Level  — No, It s Not Sam Altman, Elon Musk Analysts believe that while the vouchers will address the cost barrier, they won t solve the scarcity of resources. To further support its AI industry, Beijing is planning to roll out a subsidy program for AI groups using domestic chips. The country is also building an alternative to Big Tech s data centers and cloud services, with a network of state-run data centers and online platforms established in the past year. Why It Matters: The move by China to support its AI startups comes at a crucial time. The country is facing potential further restrictions on semiconductor exports from the U.S. and the Netherlands. This could exacerbate the chip shortage issue, making it even more critical for China to bolster its domestic AI industry. Despite these challenges, Chinese AI startups are making significant strides. For instance, 01.AI, a relatively unknown AI startup, has raised $200 million from Alibaba and others. This funding has propelled it to the top of the AI rankings, showcasing the potential of Chinese AI startups in the global market.

His choices are Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). What Happened: Niles believes that the earnings potential of these companies will drive their stock performance in 2024, reported CNBC on Sunday. Niles pointed out that the recent surge in stock prices for big tech firms was not due to their earnings but rather the Federal Reserve s policies. He anticipates a shift this year, where earnings will play a more significant role in stock market performance. Despite negative estimate revisions for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Niles  four picks continue to see analysts raise forecasts. Analysts have raised EPS expectations for the four stocks by an average of 50% since the end of last year. In contrast, estimates have remained nearly flat for Google, Tesla, and Apple. This trend has resulted in substantial stock price increases for Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. ""There's no way you can say this is a bubble from a valuation perspective, or from a time perspective, because it took five years for that internet bubble to build, and we're only one year and a quarter into the ‘AI bubble' if you want to call it so,"" Niles added. ""I think we have a lot more room to go.""

Meta s investment in Nvidia s AI chips is set to reshape the tech landscape, making Nvidia a leader in AI chip production. This investment, led by Meta s Chief Scientist Yann LeCun, highlights the crucial role of GPUs in advancing AI. Furthermore, Nvidia s stock has recently surpassed Tesla s as the most popular among retail investors, indicating a significant shift in investor sentiment. This shift is notable as Nvidia s stock has surged by 60% year-to-date, while Tesla s has seen an 18% decline. On the other hand, Amazon has seen a different trend, with financial giants making a bearish move on the company. Analysis of Amazon s options history revealed that 33% of traders were bullish, while 66% showed bearish tendencies. This trend might explain the relatively flat EPS estimates for Amazon compared to the significant increases for the other three companies. Microsoft s AI technologies are also playing a significant role in the market. Microsoft recently expanded the availability of Copilot to all users, bringing the power of AI to Windows 11 and Windows 10 users. Microsoft s use of its partnership with OpenAI, using its ChatGPT and Dall-E technologies, has brought generative AI features to Windows users.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) in the stock market is drawing parallels with the historic surge of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), sparking concerns about the sustainability of the AI frenzy. What Happened: As Nvidia s stock continues to soar, some investors are drawing parallels with Tesla s rise to the top, as reported by Bloomberg on Sunday. In 2017, Tesla s stock skyrocketed as investors anticipated the global domination of electric vehicles, propelling the company to the top of the U.S. auto industry. However, Tesla s shares have since plummeted by over 50% from their 2021 peak, and other EV stocks that surged alongside it have also seen significant declines. This serves as a cautionary tale for investors betting on Nvidia s stock as a limitless AI future. ""If you really believe in this AI frenzy, you can visualize a future 10 years from now where AI is embedded in a lot of places, and you need these massive systems running chips that can only be delivered by Nvidia,"" said&nbsp;Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. ""But just because the general macro wave is real, it doesn't mean that all of these ventures are going to turn out to be good investments.

See Also: As Dogecoin Jumps 18%, Founder Billy Markus Cracks Joke About Crypto Community:  If You Take Offense To This    Despite the differences between the two companies, such as their products and leadership, the parallels are hard to ignore. Nvidia s remarkable growth is based on the belief that its exceptional sales growth is sustainable, much like the assumption that EVs would be rapidly and widely adopted, with Tesla leading the market. However, the reality has disrupted this narrative, with EV demand slowing down and more price-conscious consumers taking longer to adopt the new technology. Tesla s stock has dropped by 31% from its recent high in July, making it one of the biggest percentage decliners in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year. Why It Matters: Retail investors have been favoring Nvidia over Tesla, with the former s stock purchases exceeding $1 billion over ten days, while Tesla s retail stock purchases amounted to just under $500 million during the same period. In February, Tesla investor Ross Gerber expressed his belief that Nvidia is significantly  undervalued  after the AI giant s record quarter.

The company recently surpassed a $2 trillion market cap following a series of record-breaking highs for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices. Notably, Nvidia s exceptional performance has been driven by its strong earnings growth from the sale of its H100 GPU chips, a trend that has been praised by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

According to Peter Callahan, a sector specialist at Goldman Sachs Global Banking &amp; Markets, it s not just a fleeting phenomenon but is rooted in sustainable and enduring fundamentals. The S&amp;P 500 Index is up over 25% in the past year. This is evident by the price appreciation seen in ETFs tracking it — the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV). At the forefront of this surge are the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. These have played a pivotal role in driving the S&amp;P 500 s recent rally. The chart above shows how the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have performed over the past year. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the surge, followed by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) next. These stocks have returned 234.86%, 164.89% and 86.70%, respectively, according to Benzinga Pro data. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) come next in the elite group. These have clocked 61.84%, 48.09%, 19.17% and 1.85% on the charts, respectively, over the past year as of Feb. 26, 2024.

Callahan Weighs In Since the beginning of 2023, these seven stocks have outshined the rest, marking an impressive 90% surge. On the other hand, the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have seen a comparatively modest 18% increase. Despite concerns about potential overvaluation and echoes of the dotcom bubble, Callahan sees a different narrative. He attributes the success of the Magnificent Seven to their strategic focus on generative AI. Beyond The Hype While the tech sector has witnessed a surge in investor sentiment due to the rise of AI, it s not just hype, says Callahan. Real revenue and earnings growth accompany the excitement, he noted. In the fourth quarter, the Magnificent Seven reported a substantial 15% year-over-year increase in revenues. Looking ahead, an annual sales growth of 12% is anticipated through 2026, reflecting a robust and sustained trajectory. Callahan asserts,  This rally has been built on a strong foundation,  expressing confidence in the continued success of these tech giants fueled by the transformative power of generative AI. As investors navigate the tech landscape, the Magnificent Seven s focus on sustainable growth and cutting-edge technologies like generative AI positions them as key players in the ongoing tech revolution. Beyond the concerns of a potential bubble, the fundamentals driving this tech rally suggest a resilient and promising journey for the Magnificent Seven and, by extension, the broader tech landscape.

TSMC&#39;s global expansion and investment in Arizona show its critical role in producing advanced chips.,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co&nbsp;(NYSE:TSM) and peer semiconductor companies are facing increasing risks of water shortages as they progress to more advanced processing technologies, according to a report by S&amp;P Global Ratings.&nbsp; Semiconductor manufacturing, essential for producing chips for devices like smartphones and TVs, demands substantial water usage to cool machinery and clean wafer sheets meticulously.&nbsp; The report highlights a direct correlation between the sophistication of semiconductor chips and water consumption, CNBC&nbsp;reports.&nbsp; As chipmakers move to more advanced semiconductor nodes, such as TSMC s shift to 16-nanometer processes, their water use per unit has surged by over 35%. This growing thirst for ultra-pure water, necessary for rinsing wafers through numerous fabrication steps, poses potential risks to the global tech supply chain, especially considering TSMC s critical role in producing approximately 90% of the world s advanced chips for AI and quantum computing.&nbsp; The report suggests that in the face of water limitations, TSMC and similar companies might prioritize the production of high-margin advanced chips over less profitable mature chips, potentially enhancing earnings despite increased water consumption.&nbsp; TSMC has made a significant leap in&nbsp;its global expansion&nbsp;by opening its first chip plant in Japan in Kumamoto, a move aimed at diversifying supply chains amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.&nbsp; It has announced further investment in a second fabrication plant in Japan in partnership with Sony Semiconductor Solutions, Toyota, and Denso. Beyond Japan, TSMC is extending its international presence with a $40 billion investment in Arizona, USA, planning two manufacturing plants to meet the American demand for semiconductors. The quarterly results of&nbsp;the chip designers&nbsp;bear testimony to the fact that the artificial intelligence frenzy is in no hurry to cool down as U.S. Big Techs keep splurging on their AI ambitions.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brett Knoblauch reiterated an Overweight rating and raised the price target from $3.60 to $5.80.,"Wedbush&nbsp;analyst Daniel Ives reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares of&nbsp;SoundHound AI Inc&nbsp;(NASDAQ:SOUN) and&nbsp;raised the price target from $5 to $9. The company delivered its fourth quarter results featuring a slight top-line miss and a&nbsp;miss on adjusted EBITDA. Revenue of $17.1 million came in below the Street's $17.7 million estimate. Its subscription and bookings backlog for FY23 increased 100% Y/Y to $661.0 million fueled by strong product royalties and strength in the automotive segment, noted the analyst. The company's FY24 guidance of $63.0 million   $77.0 million was in line with the estimate of $69.7 million and expects to see positive adjusted EBITDA as it is well-positioned to capitalize on the demand for AI chatbots, the analyst opined. SoundHound's&nbsp;acquisition of&nbsp;SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions will make it the largest U.S. provider of voice AI for restaurants, extending its market reach to over 10,000 signed locations and boosting deployment of generative AI capabilities into its product portfolio. The fourth quarter was solid as the company continues to build toward profitable growth with stable revenue pillars and strong monetization capabilities to capture demand from small players to major enterprises, noted the analyst. Cantor Fitzgerald&nbsp;analyst Brett Knoblauch reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares of SoundHound AI&nbsp;and raised the price target from $3.60 to $5.80. The company has redefined its backlog metric, the analyst notes. While the metric shows it is gathering momentum across its restaurant offering, a metric that includes a contractually committed revenue amount, such as remaining performance obligations (RPO), would be more useful. While the analyst acknowledges that being tied to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a big positive, it has only made an investment in SoundHound way back in 2017 and nothing since then. Growth can likely continue to be above 40% for the foreseeable future, and with SOUN being uniquely positioned in the AI market, the analyst believes raising the multiple used to value shares is warranted.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Using a longer term trend line or historical performance of the stock, you can aim to forecast a stock's annual rate of return. For Micron Technology, over the past 5 years, it's annualized stock performance is 17.55%, and if you assume that trend continues for another 5 years, you can expect a stock to trade at $214.35.

Investors are constantly on the hunt for undervalued, under-followed and emerging stocks. With countless methods available to retail traders, the challenge often lies in sifting through the abundance to&nbsp;uncover new information. This index layers editorial commentary to help make sense of why these stocks should be of interest and whether investors or casual readers should watch them. Related Link: Coinbase Q4 Earnings: Revenue Beat, Surprise Profit, Crypto Update And More Here is a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week of&nbsp;March 1: Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN): The cryptocurrency exchange company saw strong interest from traders during the week, which came as the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) soared past the $60,000 level. On Wednesday, an outage impacted Coinbase, which showed $0 balances for customers. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that customers accounts were safe and the errors would be fixed. Armstrong said the company was seeing a ""large surge of traffic."" The increased traffic and interest could be an item for investors to watch as cryptocurrencies are seeing renewed interest and soaring prices. Coinbase is also seen as a winner from the approval of Bitcoin ETFs as the custodian of record for many of the ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs are seeing record inflows over the past week. Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW): The cybersecurity company saw increased interest and a rebound in its share price after falling last month due to weak guidance reported. Investors are looking at cybersecurity stocks with the new regulatory rules that make companies have to keep their systems up to date to prevent security incidents from happening and report on any incidents. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said recently ""now is not the time to go negative on Palo Alto Networks."" There are brighter days ahead with cybersecurity remaining a top priority, the analyst said. Investors may also be turning their attention to Palo Alto Networks after Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi disclosed that she and her husband bought call options in the technology company. The purchase is the first disclosed by Pelosi since a recent buy of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) call options, which are up over $1 million. MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR): The software company has shares trading at 52-week highs with the surge in the price of Bitcoin leading to increased attention.

MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor previously told Benzinga that the company's ""simple strategy"" is to acquire Bitcoin and hold the Bitcoin. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH): The drink company saw shares climb to all-time highs after reporting fourth-quarter results. The company reported earnings per share and revenue that both beat Street consensus estimates. Celsius reported North American revenue of $333, which was up 97% year-over-year and international revenue of $14.6 million, which was up 68% year-over-year. While some retail traders are familiar with the company and have witnessed the 6,000% gains Along with the earnings report, an appearance by company CEO John Fieldly on CNBC may have helped increase interest in the stock. The CEO said ""there's a huge opportunity for us in the category,"" which comes as revenue has been doubling on a year-over-year basis. ""There's a ton of runway. The energy category is one of the fastest growing categories in food and beverage and we are positioned for today's health-minded consumer."" Celsius also saw several analysts raise their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Sidus Space Inc (NASDAQ:SIDU): The space-as-a-service company saw shares soar during the week after a company update said its LizzieSat satellite is preparing for a launch in March. The mission of the LizzieSat satellite includes collecting data for the agriculture, maritime and oil and gas sectors. The company previously appeared on the Stock Whisper Index in January after receiving a Tier 1 remote sensing license and sharing an update on the LizzieSat launch.

The stock is already up over 40% YTD, and has had a good run-up of 185% over the past year, making it the second-highest price returns generator among the Magnificent Seven stocks. The lead is maintained by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) which has returned over 248% so far in the year.

Benzinga looked at some technical indicators and analyst ratings for these answers. On the technical side, Meta stock exhibits a strongly bullish trend. Its share price surpasses its 5, 20, and 50-day exponential moving averages, indicating robust buying pressure. The stock s current price is above the 8-day simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA), as well as the 20-day SMA and EMA, all suggesting a bullish signal. The 50-day SMA and EMA, along with the 200-day SMA, also support a bullish outlook. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator at 28.51 is also a bullish indicator. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 69.82, however, suggests the stock is overbought. Bollinger Bands for both short-term (25) and long-term (100) periods advocate a bullish outlook as well. The Consensus analyst rating on Meta s stock stands at a Buy, with a price target of $427.87.

It is a union that will allow the company to  further distance itself from the competition  and sustain double-digit revenue and profitability growth for years to come, according to Stifel analyst Brad Reback.  This is the first time in over two decades Microsoft is not playing from behind in an emerging tech trend,  said Reback. He added:  We believe its increasing GenAI scale will become a meaningful competitive advantage as the company is able to leverage the virtuous circle generated by its unique Infrastructure &amp; Application usage-based insights to inform its future investment and monetization strategies.  Indeed, although GenAI development is setting a blistering pace, few companies have been able to leverage it at a scale where it can add significantly to profits.

Furthermore, it can use data on AI usage by its customers within Azure to help inform it on future investment and monetization decisions.  Overall, we believe Microsoft s AI infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) opportunity could very well potentially double Azure s total addressable market,  Reback said. But what does this mean for future revenues and profits at Microsoft? Reback noted that it took Azure around three years to reach $1.9 billion of annual revenue, but AI IaaS/PaaS workloads should be approaching a $7 billion run-rate by the end of this year.

In this article, we will perform a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) against its key competitors in the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment industry. By analyzing important financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.

The elevated Price to Book ratio of 46.02 relative to the industry average by 6.37x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value. The Price to Sales ratio of 32.39, which is 3.38x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers. With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 32.23% that is 26.4% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $14.56 Billion, which is 3.6x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation. The gross profit of $16.79 Billion is 4.29x above that of its industry, highlighting stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. The company is experiencing remarkable revenue growth, with a rate of 265.28%, outperforming the industry average of -2.51%. Debt To Equity Ratio The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity. Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making. By evaluating NVIDIA against its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following observations arise: When considering the debt-to-equity ratio, NVIDIA exhibits a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers. This indicates that the company has a favorable balance between debt and equity, with a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.26, which can be perceived as a positive aspect by investors. Key Takeaways For NVIDIA in the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest strong market sentiment and revenue multiples. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth, NVIDIA outperforms its industry peers, reflecting strong financial performance and growth potential.

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is currently trading around the level of 508.34. For those bullish on SPY, the initial goal is to see the price climb to 508.83. Should the market maintain its strength above this level, the next objective for buyers would be to elevate the price to the support level at 509.49. Holding above this support during the trading day could signal a further ascent towards 510.14. Continuing the bullish perspective, if 510.14 is surpassed, the next target for the bulls is set at 510.95. This level represents the high bull target for SPY today, indicating a significant bullish outcome if achieved. On the flip side, if the support at 508.34 fails to hold, the market may turn bearish. The initial test for the bears would be at the level of 507.52. A breach here would prompt a further examination of the market s strength at 506.71. Should selling intensify, the next support level at 506.06 could be in jeopardy. In a scenario where selling pressure dominates, and 506.06 is compromised, the market may descend to the low bear target for the day at 505.32. This level represents a crucial point for bears, indicating a strong sell-off if reached. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), often referred to as the Q s, is navigating the market around a pivotal level of 438.89. Bulls in the market are aiming for the price to sustain above 440.00, which would serve as a sign of strength. Holding firm at this level would set the stage for a move towards 440.78, deemed a significant support level. If bullish momentum persists, the next target for buyers is 441.56, with an ultimate goal of reaching 442.53. Achieving this would indicate a strong bullish trend, with the high bull target for the day set at 444.09 for the Q s. Conversely, should the Q s struggle to maintain levels above 438.89, it could signal bearish control. The first level for bears to challenge would be 437.47. A downturn from here would likely lead to a test of 436.58, with further weakness potentially bringing 435.88 into play. If the bears continue to drive the market lower, the next critical point would be the low bear target for the day at 434.76. Reaching this level would signify a substantial bearish move in the market. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) current market position is around the 178.61 level. Bulls are hopeful that this level will act as a firm support, setting the stage for a rally towards 179.36. Should the bullish trend continue, the next targets would be 180.10 and the high bull target of 180.60, indicating a strong upward movement in Apple s stock price today. If, however, Apple fails to maintain support at 178.61, it could lead to bearish sentiment. The first lower level to watch would be 178.18, followed by 177.20 if the selling pressure increases. A further decline could bring 176.84 into focus. In a more pronounced bearish scenario, if 176.84 cannot hold, the price might be pushed down to the low bear target for the day at 176.29. This level would represent a significant downturn for Apple s stock. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft&nbsp;(NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading around the 413.14 mark. Bulls are looking for the price to remain robust above this level, with a rally towards 414.56 as the initial target. If this level holds as support, it could lead to further bullish momentum towards 416.32 and potentially reaching the high bull target of 417.25. Should Microsoft s price fail to find support at 413.14, it would open the door for bearish activity. The first level of interest for bears would be 411.72, followed by 410.64 if the downtrend persists. A continued decline would put 409.69 in focus. If the bearish trend deepens and 409.69 is breached, the next significant level to watch is the low bear target at 408.46. This would indicate a considerable pullback in Microsoft s stock price. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is presently positioned around the 799.10 level. Bulls are eyeing an upward push towards 804.61, which would need to be established as a firm support level for further gains. The subsequent bullish targets are set at 810.13 and 816.95, with an ambitious high bull target for the day at 823.52. On the contrary, if NVIDIA cannot maintain support at 799.10, it could signal a shift towards bearish sentiment. The initial level for bears to target would be 794.94. A breakdown below this level could lead to further declines towards 791.44 and 787.68. In a scenario where selling pressure dominates, and 787.68 is compromised, the focus would shift to the low bear target for the day at 785.35. This level would mark a significant downturn for NVIDIA s stock. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is currently trading at around the 138.39 level. For a bullish outlook, this level needs to be sustained as support, with the next targets set at 139.46 and the high bull target of 140.05. Achieving these levels would indicate strong bullish momentum in Alphabet s stock. However, if Alphabet s stock fails to hold the 138.39 level as support, it could lead to bearish tendencies. The first level for bears to test would be 137.79, followed by 136.94 if the downward trend continues. A more significant sell-off could bring the price to the low bear target of the day at 136.29. Meta Platforms Inc Meta Platforms&nbsp;(NASDAQ:META) is hovering around the 492.33 mark. Bulls are looking for the stock to stay firm above this level, with an upward movement towards 495.54 as the next target. Further bullish momentum could lead to targets of 498.03 and the high bull target of 500.83. If Meta fails to maintain support at 492.33, it could indicate bearish sentiment. The first lower target would be 488.81, with continued selling pressure potentially bringing the price down to 485.96. A break below this level could lead to the low bear target of the day at 483.11. Tesla Inc. Tesla s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) current market level is 200.43. Bulls are aiming for a push towards 201.85, with continued buying potentially leading to higher levels at 204.33 and 206.71. A bullish market today could see Tesla reaching the high bull target of 209.51. Conversely, if Tesla cannot sustain support at 200.43, it may face a downward test at 197.50. Further selling could bring the levels of 195.91 into focus, with a significant bearish move potentially leading to the low bear target of 193.81.

"," Nvidia, originally focused on PC gaming chips, has transformed into a major player in the AI industry. Nvidia s stock price reached over $800, attracting investor attention, although there are concerns about potential overvaluation, suggesting a possible short-term market correction. Nvidia experienced a 56% increase in stock value in the early part of the year, with a further 16% rise following impressive Q4 earnings, indicating strong performance and investor confidence. Technical analysis shows Nvidia s stock approaching a potential support zone around $716, with investors and traders closely watching for a rebound and future resistance at the $1000 mark. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the rare publicly traded companies to hit the $2 trillion mark, has been on an interesting journey. Originally focused on PC gaming chips, it has become a major player in the AI realm. Its gaming roots are shaped by revolutionary GPUs, and Nvidia has shifted strategically towards AI. Now, its chips are essential for companies at the forefront of the AI revolution, far beyond just gaming PCs. This transformation has propelled Nvidia s valuation to new heights. Nvidia s dominance in the AI space is highlighted by its collaboration with Mark Zuckerberg s Meta, aiming to construct the &quot;world s fastest AI supercomputer.&quot; This endeavor serves as a significant affirmation of Nvidia s cutting-edge technology. Meta plans to expand the boundaries of AI capabilities by leveraging Nvidia s chips, solidifying Nvidia s pivotal role in shaping the future of technology. Nvidia s valuation is closely tied to assumptions regarding the future of AI, emphasizing the growing need for swift, efficient chips and the significance of centralized data centers in AI advancements. While current trends favor Nvidia, the rapid evolution of the tech industry suggests that any shifts could impact Nvidia s standing as a leader in AI technology. Nvidia s stock price reflects its corporate successes, reaching over $800 recently, catching the eye of investors. Some are selling off as they ponder potential overvaluation with this significant resistance level. Yet, the stock s existing momentum hints that this dip could be a short-term correction, not a lasting pattern. The company s stock has seen a strong start in the first two months of the year, with a notable 56% bullish surge. The impressive Q4 earnings further boosted the stock price by 16% after the announcement, underlining the company s strong performance and investor confidence. Analyzing from a technical perspective, the recent stock pullback might bring it closer to the daily 20 simple moving average, positioned around $716. This level is considered a potential support zone that could act as a springboard for the stock to recover and continue its upward trend. Looking ahead, investors are eyeing the significant psychological resistance at $1000. After the closing bell on Wednesady, February 28, the stock closed at $776.63, trading down by 1.32%.

(NASDAQ:AMD), which closed at a record high on Thursday, are climbing yet again in premarket trading as they aim at cracking the $200 level. AMD rose over 9% before settling Thursday s session at $192.53, off the day s high of $193, with the catalyst being positive commentary from Citigroup. The firm said it models global semiconductor sales growth of more than 11%, which is attributable to AI-related demand. It also named AMD, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Broadcom, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as its preferred names. Thursday s rally pushed AMD s market valuation past the $300 billion level. With Nvidia s valuation stretched, some investors will likely look past the stock and into affordable names. In a mid-January note, Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley mentioned AMD among names that will likely benefit from the second wave of AI. He sees AMD exiting 2024 with an AI revenue run-rate of $4 billion, which will likely increase to more than $7 billion in 2025 as customers scout for a second source for AI accelerators. Citing channel checks, the analyst said AMD s MI300 AI accelerator has received stronger feedback.  MI300 AI accelerator has received stronger feedback. AMD shares are trading at a forward price-earnings multiple of 57.47 compared to Nvidia s 33.33. Going by the average analysts  price target, Nvidia has over 11% upside potential compared to a more modest 2%+ for AMD. In premarket, AMD gained 2.80% to $197.93 and Nvidia rose 1.06% to $799.50, according to Benzinga Pro data.

What Happened: Nvidia s stock, which has been on a meteoric rise, has surged by approximately 60% this year, following a threefold increase in 2023. This has propelled the company s market value to nearly $2 trillion, making it the third-largest U.S. company by market cap, after Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Reuters reported. As a result, Wall Street is now on the lookout for other AI-focused companies, with the consensus being that AI is here to stay. The surge in AI interest has driven the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record high, with the S&amp;P 500 also reaching a new high. See Also: Floki Staking Hits Record $105M, Surges Ahead Of Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, Shiba Inu In Total Locked Value Goldman Sachs analysts have noted a significant increase in AI mentions during conference calls in the fourth quarter, indicating a growing fixation on AI. A Morgan Stanley survey also suggests that 2024 is  a Year of Investment for AI,  with AI/machine learning being named as the top priority for the first time by chief information officers. ""It s not a fad,  said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments  Large Cap Focused Fund.  There are too many   cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines."" According to portfolio manager Zehrid Osmani, the Martin Currie U.S. Unconstrained Fund has allocated nearly 10% of its assets, the maximum allowed for one stock, to Nvidia. Osmani is confident that Nvidia will sustain its competitive edge by investing more heavily in research and development compared to its rivals. Why It Matters: The surge in AI-related stocks, particularly Nvidia, has raised concerns about a potential bubble in the market. Renowned finance professor Jeremy Siegel recently warned of a possible bubble forming, although he acknowledged that it is impossible to predict when it will burst. However, other experts like tech venture capitalist Gene Munster have dismissed fears of an imminent bubble burst, pointing to the strong performance of tech giants and the AI sector. The recent strong performance of mid-cap AI companies like c3.ai and Microsoft s high demand for its Copilot AI tool has been cited as early proof of an accelerating AI revolution. Despite the risks, many investors are still confident in sticking with big Nvidia positions.

What Happened: New York University professor&nbsp;Aswath Damodaran, known as the  Dean of Valuation,  cautioned against considering Nvidia as a good long-term investment. In a CNBC interview on Thursday, Damodaran said:  Right now, Nvidia is in a strange place it s a great trade but not a very good investment.   Trading is about mood and momentum, and when you think mood and momentum, I don t think I have ever seen a company celebrated as much as Nvidia,  he said. He noted Nvidia s CEO Jensen Huang is celebrated as the  greatest CEO ever walked on the face of the earth  and people are hyping it up by saying the company cannot be stopped. Damodaran, called the  Dean of Valuation,  said this is a perception that drives prices up.  From mood and momentum, at some point in time, the fever breaks, and the question is when that ll happen for Nvidia. It will still be a great company, but I think the pricing is a little bit out of control,  he said. The professor, however, did not rule out the gravity of the AI revolution.  I think we have to accept his AI is real, it s going to make a real difference to business and I think Nvidia is in the front seat of that market,  he said.  That said though that pathway is not as easy and as open to profits as the market seems to be assuming it is.  See Also: Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Is Nvidia Worth Getting In Now? Damodaran, who had a position in Nvidia, sold his stake in the chipmaker last year, reasoning that he couldn t hold onto the stock as a value investor, especially following its strong run-up. On Thursday, the value investor said the  question to ask now if you re an investor is, if I get in now, what am I pricing it.  If you remove the $2 trillion market cap from the pricing to break even, Nvidia has to add about $400 billion in revenues to what it has now, he said. For the fiscal year 2024, the company reported revenue of $60.92 billion. Damodaran sees this as a daunting task but it is plausible.  But investing is about the game of the probable and if you play the plausible game, you re setting yourself up to lose. You re done,  he said. The NYU professor, however, said all engines of Nvidia are firing at full force right now and the company could beat earnings and revenue expectations again. This is what pricing is all about, he said.  That s why I said it s a good trade. It s in the near term they re more likely to deliver upside surprises but in the long term if you price the company to be the best company ever where is the upside.  Damodaran s views contrast with many on the Street. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer has been recommending Nvidia as a stock to hold and not one to trade. Deepwater Asset Management s Gene Munster concedes that we are in an AI bubble but sees the bubble lasting for another three to five years. Nvidia ended Thursday s session up 1.87% at $791.12, according to Benzinga Pro data.

A reliable measure to gauge this potential is comparing the current stock price with the 1-year median price target projected by Wall Street analysts. Among the top 10 S&amp;P 500 stocks year-to-date, Uber Technologies stands out with the largest potential upside to its median price target, showing a significant difference of 13.8%. Catalent follows closely behind, boasting a 10% potential upside, while Nvidia still maintains a respectable 7% upside compared to its median price target.

Recognized as the pioneer ETF issuer in this space, Roundhill Investments launched the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE:MAGS) last year, featuring an equally weighted exposure to Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), with quarterly rebalancing. Expanding the investment horizon within this select group of stocks, Roundhill has now unveiled the Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE:MAGQ) and the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE:MAGX). Both began trading on Thursday. A Complete Toolkit For Traders To Express Views On Magnificent 7  We wanted to offer a complete toolkit for investors and traders to express views on Magnificent Seven,  Dave Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investment, said Thursday in an exclusive interview with Benzinga. According to the market expert, Magnificent Seven have been in the  driver s seat  thus far, but he highlighted an increasing interest among traders in taking contrarian positions due to the significant market concentration, anticipating potential market shifts. Both ETFs are structured around daily total return swaps. The Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF aims to deliver the inverse daily return of the Magnificent Seven basket. For instance, a 2% decline in the underlying stocks would be translated into a 2% increase in MAGQ ETF value, and vice versa. Conversely, the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF seeks to provide twice the daily total return of the group, amplifying gains or losses accordingly. For example, a 2% rise in the Magnificent Seven stocks would result in a 4% increase in MAGX ETF value, but likewise, negative performance would be magnified. Mazza expressed confidence in attracting new inflows into these newly launched funds and reiterated Roundhill s commitment in the offering of innovative ETFs. Over the past two months alone, the  plain-vanilla  Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has garnered over $100 million if inflows, pushing its total assets under management to $152 million. The fund has seen nearly a 14% increase year-to-date and more than a 50% surge since its inception in April 2023.

This has caused bearish divergence to occur on SOXL&rsquo;s chart, which indicates the ETF is losing momentum. Bullish traders want to see SOXL close Thursday&rsquo;s trading session above the Feb. 23 high of $42.68, which will cause the higher high to be confirmed, indicating the uptrend remains intact. Bearish traders want to see SOXL close under that level, which could cause a bullish double-top pattern to form, indicating a retracement is on the horizon. SOXL has resistance above at $44.97 and at the psychologically important $50 mark. The ETF has support below at $41.60 and at $39.53. ","['AMD', 'NVDA', 'SOXL', 'SOXS']",0.25,benzinga

Optimism and complacency could lead to a &#39;meltup&#39;.","The current euphoria on Wall Street, characterized by a seemingly unstoppable bull run, has raised eyebrows among seasoned market observers, including Ed Yardeni. Yardeni, who has consistently maintained a positive outlook on the stock market over the past year, has recently expressed some nervousness as he observes the bulls  unchecked advance on Wall Street.  Today, there are lots of happy bulls, including us. We would be happier if there were fewer bulls,  Yardeni wrote in a recent post. The Nasdaq 100 Index, as tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), is up by 28% since late October 2023, marking fifteen out of seventeen weeks in the green. The S&amp;P 500 s top performing stock – Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) – has risen by over 60% in the first two months of the year, on top of the 240% growth witnessed during 2023. Excessive Optimism: A Double-Edged Sword Yardeni points to an overwhelming optimism fueling the U.S. stock market s growth as a potential red flag.  We have nothing to fear but nothing to fear. The Fed is done tightening. The economy is doing fine. Inflation is moderating. The stock market is hitting record highs. So what s wrong with this picture? Nothing, except that it mirrors the consensus view, which we also share,  he explains. Unheeded Warnings From Contrarian Indicators Highlighting the risk of complacency, Yardeni references some key contrarian indicators that suggest bullish sentiment may have reached an unsustainable peak. Notably, the Investors Intelligence Bull/Bear Ratio recently hit 3.54, marking a zenith since the bull market s inception, before slightly receding to 3.45. Yardeni highlights that this ratio historically signals a more compelling buy opportunity when below 1.00, rather than serving as a sell signal above 3.50. Similarly, the Bull/Bear Ratio measured by the American Association of Individual Investors points to widespread bullish optimism, as it hovers well above the threshold of 1. Source: Yardeni Research Furthermore, the Put/Call Ratio also indicates a prevailing disregard for risk, with put option purchases lagging significantly behind calls. Yardeni noted that retail investors  recent fervor for equity ETFs has disproportionately benefited the so-called MegaCap-8, underscoring a feedback loop that might herald a market  meltup.  Yardeni concludes with a cautionary stance:  A minor correction in the S&amp;P 500 is unlikely to dampen the bullish fervor. Should the market ascend further, in defiance of these contrarian sell signals, it could signify the onset of a meltup.  While Wall Street s bulls continue their jubilant charge, Yardeni s analysis offers a sobering counterpoint, suggesting that too much of a good thing could indeed be worrisome.

","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Inflation Gauge Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of&nbsp;SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&amp;P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market has failed to make progress since the release of hotter CPI. The chart shows that the stock market was pulling back before the release of PCE, but improved on release of PCE. The stock market has been anxiously awaiting PCE.&nbsp;PCE is the Fed&rsquo;s favorite inflation gauge.&nbsp;PCE rose the most in a year.&nbsp;Here are the details: Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus. Core PCE came at 0.4% vs. 0.4% consensus. In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market improved on the release of the PCE data as there was fear of an even worse number. Digging into the data that underlies PCE, in The Arora Report analysis, there is deflation in goods, but there is serious inflation in services.&nbsp;Deflation in goods is coming from China. The release of PCE data has triggered aggressive buying in AI stocks and bitcoin. The buying is especially aggressive in C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) after the release of PCE data.&nbsp;C3.ai released better than expected earnings after the close yesterday.&nbsp;As a full disclosure, a signal was given in The Arora Report s&nbsp;ZYX Buy Change Alert. The release of PCE data is also leading to very aggressive buying in small caps.&nbsp;As a full disclosure, iShares Russell 2000 ETF&nbsp;(NYSE:IWM) and its&nbsp;buy zone are in The Arora Report s&nbsp;ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio. Personal income and spending data was also released this morning.&nbsp;Here are the details: Personal spending came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus. Personal income came at 1.0% vs. 0.5% consensus. Weekly initial claims came at 215K vs. 206K consensus.&nbsp;This indicates that the jobs picture remains strong, especially at the low end.&nbsp;However, the jobs picture is getting weaker in IT as many jobs are being replaced by AI. Yesterday, the Fed&rsquo;s Williams, Collins, and Bostic said that the Fed will continue to be date dependent.&nbsp;Bostic said that he sees the first rate cut this summer, while Collins and Williams see the first rate cut later in 2024. More Fed speak is ahead today from Fed Presidents Raphael Bostic, Austan Goolsbee, and Loretta Mester. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Japan As we have been writing, prudent investors need to pay attention to Bank of Japan policies.&nbsp;Not only is the Japanese stock market hitting a new 34 year high, but interest rates and movements in Japan impact the U.S. stock market. Bank of Japan board member Hajime Takata signaled a strong case for raising interest rates.&nbsp;The yen jumped.&nbsp;As a full disclosure, ETFs iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE:EWJ) and Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY) are in The Arora Report s&nbsp;ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.

Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) soared to $64,000 yesterday before pulling back.&nbsp;Release of PCE data brought aggressive buying into bitcoin.&nbsp;Bitcoin is now approaching $64,000 again. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp;If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is currently trading around the level of 505.32. For a bullish scenario, we are looking for an initial upward movement towards 506.06. Should the price action sustain strength above this level, we anticipate buyers driving the price to the next level at 506.71. Holding firm at 506.71 during the regular trading hours could signal a further push upwards towards 507.52, with an ultimate high target for the bulls at 508.34 for the day. On the flip side, if the support at 505.32 fails to hold, we expect the bears to make a move towards testing the 503.95 level for weakness. Should selling pressure intensify, a further drop to 502.85 might be observed. Breaking below this level could lead to a test of the stronger support level at 501.74, with a bearish target for the day set at 500.91 if the sell-off continues. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The Q s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:QQQ) are navigating around the crucial level of 434.76. For a bullish outlook, we aim to see the level of 435.88 acting as solid support, with the potential to escalate to 436.58 if maintained. A continuation of buying pressure might bring 437.47 into focus, with a strong day possibly extending the gains to 438.89. The ultimate bullish target for the day is set at 440.00. Conversely, if the level of 434.76 cannot be maintained during regular trading hours, we expect the bears to push the price down to 433.64. A further decline in strength could see the price testing 432.84, with a persistent sell-off potentially leading to a test of 431.82. If this support level gives way, the bearish objective for the day is to reach 431.18. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) current trading position is around 180.60. In a bullish scenario, we are looking for the price to hold above 181.25, with potential gains targeting 182.27. Should the upward momentum continue, we might see a rally towards 182.96, with the high bull target for the day set at 183.38. If the support at 180.60 cannot be maintained, we anticipate a downward test to 180.10. Continued selling pressure could drive the price further down to 179.36, with a further drop potentially leading to 178.61. Should this level not hold, the bearish target for the day is set at 178.18. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft&nbsp;(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently trading around the level of 406.01. For bulls, holding above this level is crucial, with a target set at 407.11 to be maintained as support. Success at this level could see the price rallying towards 408.46, with the day s high bull target at 409.69. Should the support at 406.01 falter, we expect the bears to target 404.92. A breakdown below this level could lead to further bearish probing at 402.74, with sustained pressure possibly driving the price down to 401.39. The bearish target for the day is set at 400.30. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) is oscillating around the key level of 775.50. Bulls are looking to push the price up to 781.59 and establish it as a clear support zone. Success here could lead to a further rally towards 785.35, with continued buying interest possibly reaching 787.68. The day s high bull target is set at 791.44. If the 775.50 support level does not hold, we anticipate a bearish move towards 771.72. A break below this could see the price dropping to 768.67, with a weaker auction possibly testing 765.63. In a bearish scenario, the day s target is set at 761.29. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL)&nbsp;is trading around the level of 135.66. Bulls are looking to maintain this as support and push higher to 136.29. Sustained bullish momentum could see the auction reaching our high bull target of 137.79. On the other hand, if 135.66 cannot act as support, we expect bears to push the price down to 134.96. A breakdown from this level could lead to a test of 133.78, with a significant sell-off potentially reaching our bearish target for the day at 132.84. Meta Platforms Inc Meta&nbsp;(NASDAQ:META) is trading around the level of 483.11. For a bullish view, we expect the auction to stay strong above 485.96, with an upward move targeting 488.81. A continuation of strong buying could see the price reaching 492.33, with the high bull target set at 495.54. If the support at 483.11 fails, we look towards a bearish move to 480.96. Further selling pressure could bring the price down to 479.47, with a breakdown targeting our low bear target for the day at 477.50. Tesla Inc. Tesla&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) is currently trading around the key level of 201.85. Bulls are aiming to drive the price up to 204.33, with a sustained buying effort potentially reaching 206.71. A bullish market today could see Tesla testing higher levels up to 209.51, with the ultimate bull target for the day set at 211.53. If the support at 201.85 does not hold, we anticipate a bearish test to 200.43, with continued selling pressure bringing 197.50 into focus. A break below this level could see a further drop to the day s low bear target at 195.91.

Futures up for Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, and small caps.","Thursday s premarket trading session saw substantial upward momentum propelled by major tech stocks, laying the groundwork for a promising session for U.S. equity indices. This surge comes as the Fed s preferred measure of inflation meets anticipated levels from last month, thereby failing to disrupt expectations of potential interest rate cuts in the first half of the year. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index edged up 0.6% to 18,000 points at 8:50 a.m. in New York, poised to fully recover Wednesday s losses, according to data from the Benzinga Pro platform. Contracts on the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,090 points, reaching levels last observed at the beginning of the week. The Dow Jones, which has limited exposure to tech stocks, saw only a marginal increase of 0.1%. The most significant reaction was seen in small-cap stocks, with contracts on the Russell 2000 index, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), surging by 1.6%. Yields on Treasury bonds fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield dropping to 4.25%. Market-implied probabilities on a Fed rate cut by June inched higher to 67%, up from Wednesday s 62%.

What Happened: The Unusual Whales Democratic ETF (BATS:NANC), in a nod to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has seen a 30% surge since its inception on Feb. 7, 2023. This growth surpasses the 24% gain of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period, reported Business Insider. The ETF s performance is largely attributed to its significant investments in major tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). These four companies are the fund s largest holdings, with Microsoft alone accounting for nearly 10% of the fund. See Also: Crypto Analyst Predicts Breakout For Two Dogecoin Rival:  Meme Season Feels Like It Is Heating Up Again  The ETF includes tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Salesforce, and Alphabet. These six stocks make up 32% of the fund s total market value. The fund comprises a total of 719 stocks. It s worth noting that the lawmakers tracked by the fund also hold shares in many of the same stocks that are popular with hedge funds. This has led to the fund s impressive performance, despite the ongoing scrutiny of lawmakers  stock trades. In contrast, a Republican-centric fund following a similar approach has been lagging behind the market. The Unusual Whales Republican ETF, identified by the ticker symbol  KRUZ,  has only seen a modest 15% gain since its inception. Why It Matters: The Unusual Whales Democratic ETF was launched in response to the controversial stock trading activities of members of Congress. This issue has been under the spotlight for some time, with calls for a ban on congressional stock trading. In 2023, a bill proposing a ban on congressional stock trading was introduced by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Josh Hawley (R-MO). Despite the controversy, the Unusual Whales Democratic ETF has continued to perform well, reflecting the market s confidence in the stocks favored by Democratic lawmakers. This also aligns with the trend of members of Congress outperforming the S&amp;P 500. One of the most scrutinized members of Congress for her trading history of stocks and options is Pelosi. After recently profiting more than $1 million from a trade in Nvidia, Pelosi disclosed a new technology stock purchase by her and her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi. This ongoing success and the subsequent launch of the NANC ETF have brought the trading activities of Democratic lawmakers into the limelight.

The Coinbase Trade Ark Invest sold 86,298 Coinbase shares on Wednesday through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK). The transaction was valued at $17.33 million.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged a significant increase in traffic, expressing regret for any inconvenience caused to users. Despite users encountering zero balances and transaction errors, Coinbase assured the safety of their assets and reported gradual improvements in trading by Wednesday afternoon, although some issues with logging in, transactions, and payment methods persisted due to the continued high traffic volume. This sell-off by Ark Invest follows a pattern of reducing exposure to Coinbase, as detailed in earlier coverage, amidst a rallying Bitcoin.

What Happened: Cramer, on his show  Mad Money,  emphasized the need to read between the lines during earnings season. He pointed out that the current method of reporting on stocks is failing to provide an accurate representation of a company s worth, reported CNBC on Tuesday. ""It's the way we report on stocks, all of us: It's not working anymore, it's failing us, it's too glib, too inconsistent, too unrepresentative of a company's worth. The reportage is causing people to make snap judgments that turn out to be false judgments, and it's got to stop,"" Cramer said. Using the recent earnings of Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) and Lowe s Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) as examples, Cramer highlighted the importance of looking beyond the headlines. Despite a year-over-year sales decline, Home Depot s CEO, Ted Decker, expressed confidence in the company s inventory position. Cramer suggested that this could lead to improved future earnings. Similarly, Lowe s CEO, Marvin Ellison, acknowledged a near-term pressure on do-it-yourself projects but noted a stable sales trend among home professionals.

He advised investors to focus on the company s assurance of a steady supply of discounted merchandise. Despite expressing doubt about a potential change in the headline process, Cramer pledged to continue providing accurate and insightful information to help investors make informed decisions. ""I have no illusions about this issue — It's extremely unlikely that the headline process will actually change,"" Cramer said. ""But my job is to entertain, educate and help you make money, and the best way to do that right now is to do the homework, listen to the conference call, shoot against the headline writers."" Why It Matters: Cramer s advice comes at a time when the market is experiencing a mix of uncertainties and positive performances. Amid the best year since 1999, investors are looking for guidance on how to navigate the market. Earlier, Cramer had commended companies like Domino s Pizza for their resilience amid market uncertainties. He also highlighted the strong performances of companies like Nvidia and Amazon during the first earnings season of 2024. On the other hand, Cramer has also expressed concerns about the diverse business ventures of companies like Alphabet and the lack of transparency. He suggested that a more focused approach could potentially boost the stock performance of these companies.

She's made a name for herself with big bets and brash predictions like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) topping $1 million by 2030. These bets have often paid off, 2020's bull run saw her flagship fund, ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), triple the performance of the S&amp;P 500. But Wood's recent track record has been lackluster. So far this year ARKK is up just over 2%, compared to almost 7% for the S&amp;P. And it gets worse when stacked up against other tech-focused funds. The indexed Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up nearly 8%. A more one-to-one comparison, the actively managed Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX), is up over 14%. Missed The Boat The monster returns of the last year have been mostly driven by the AI craze, especially Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), up over 400% since the beginning of 2023. In 2024 alone, Nvidia is up more than 60%. Wood sold ARKK's shares last January, missing the entire ride. Instead, Wood's biggest AI backing is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has continued to miss earnings and is down nearly 20% on the year. In fact, 6 of ARKK's top 10 holdings are losers this year so far, 3 of those in the double digits. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is currently the biggest holding and is up 26.99%, YTD. But Wood missed out on some of this by selling a large chunk of its COIN shares. COIN is up 21% from last Tuesday. Flight Of The Funds Investors frustrated by missing out on the huge gains seen across the market have been pulling their money out in big ways. So far in 2024, ARKK has a net loss in assets under management of $845 million, roughly 10% of the fund in less than 2 months. For The Bears For traders not buying what Wood is selling, inverse ETFs provide a straightforward way to bet against a stock, avoiding the complications that come with option trading. The AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (NASDAQ:SARK), which aims to return the inverse performance of ARKK, is a perfect example. Traders still bullish on Wood and her fund and want to maximize their view can buy a leveraged fund, like the AXS 2X Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:TARK) which aims to return twice the daily return of ARKK. TARK was awarded Best ETF Launch at Benzinga's 2023 Fintech Awards. Photo by Drew Beamer on Unsplash.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY ETF&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is presently trading around the key level of 505.32. For those looking for upward movement, the initial target is 506.06. Should the market sustain above this level, the next goal for buyers is to reach 506.71, which is considered a support level. Holding above 506.71 could signal further upward momentum, aiming for 507.52. On the bullish side, if SPY manages to maintain its strength above 507.52 during the trading session, the ultimate objective for the day is to reach 508.34. This level represents the high target for bulls, indicating significant buying interest and positive market sentiment. Conversely, if SPY fails to maintain support at 505.32, the market may see bearish activity. The initial downside target for bears is 503.95, where the market will test selling pressure. A breach below this level would lead to further tests at 502.85, indicating increased bearish momentum. Should selling intensify, the next critical support level to watch is 501.74. A breakdown below this point could lead to a significant bearish move, with the final bear target for the day set at 500.91. This level represents a key point where bears aim to push the market, highlighting potential downside risks. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ ETF&nbsp;(NASDAQ:QQQ) is currently navigating around the pivotal level of 435.88. Bullish investors aim to push the price above 436.58, looking for it to act as a solid support level. If successful, the next target is 437.47, which bulls hope to establish as a new support base, potentially leading to further upward movement towards 438.89. If the market momentum remains positive, bulls will look to challenge the 440.00 level, with the ultimate bull target for the day being 440.78. Achieving this target would indicate strong buyer dominance and a favorable outlook for the QQQ ETF. On the flip side, if QQQ struggles to stay above 435.88, bears might take the upper hand, driving the price down to 434.76. This would be the first test of bearish strength, with a further downside target at 433.64 if the selling pressure persists. A continued bearish trend could see QQQ dropping to 432.84, and if this support level fails, the final bear target for the day is set at 431.82. This level represents the lowest point bears aim to reach, signifying a significant downward movement if achieved. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is currently trading near the 182.27 level. Bulls are eyeing this level to hold as support, with an immediate target of 182.96. Sustaining above this could lead to further bullish momentum, pushing the price towards 183.38. If the bullish trend continues, the next objective for buyers is to surpass 184.09, marking the high bull target for the day. Achieving this would indicate strong buying interest and a positive sentiment towards Apple s stock. However, if Apple fails to maintain support at 182.27, the market could see a downward trend, with the initial bear target set at 181.25. A break below this level would indicate bearish pressure, leading to a potential test of 180.60. With continued selling, the next level to watch is 180.10. If this support fails, the final bear target for the day is 179.36, suggesting a significant bearish outlook if reached. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently finding its footing around 406.01. Bulls are looking for the stock to hold above this level, aiming for an initial rally to 407.11. If this level acts as strong support, the next target for upward movement is 408.46. Continued buying could propel Microsoft s stock towards the high bull target of 409.69 for the day. Reaching this level would signify robust bullish momentum and positive market sentiment. Conversely, if Microsoft cannot maintain support at 406.01, bears may aim to push the price down to 404.92. A break below this level would signal increased bearish activity, with a further downside target at 402.74. If the bearish trend persists, the next critical level is 401.39. Failing to hold this could lead to a move towards the day s low bear target of 400.30, marking a significant bearish stance if achieved. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently oscillating around the crucial level of 775.50. Bulls are aiming for an upward push to 781.59, seeking to establish it as a firm support level. If successful, the next target is 785.35, with the potential to further rally to 787.68. If buying continues to dominate, NVIDIA could see its price reaching the high bull target of 791.44 for the day, indicating strong bullish momentum and a favorable market outlook. On the contrary, if NVIDIA fails to hold the 775.50 level, bears might drive the price down to 771.72. A breakdown below this level could signal a bearish trend, with the next target at 768.67. Persistent selling could lead to a test of 765.63, and if this level doesn t hold, the final bear target for the day is 761.29. This level represents a significant bearish objective, highlighting potential downside risks. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is currently trading around 138.39. Bulls are looking to secure 139.46 as a support level, aiming for an upward move to 140.05. Sustaining bullish momentum could lead to reaching the high bull target of 140.57. However, if Alphabet cannot maintain support at 138.39, bears may aim to lower the price to 137.79. A breach below this level would indicate a bearish trend, with a further downside target at 136.94. Continued bearish pressure could push Alphabet s stock down to 136.29, marking the low bear target for the day. Reaching this level would signify a significant bearish outlook for Alphabet. Meta Platforms Inc Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)&nbsp;is currently positioned around 483.11. Bulls are aiming to keep the price above 485.96, with a subsequent target of 488.81. A strong bullish trend could lead to a further rally to 492.33. If the buying interest persists, Meta could see its price reaching the high bull target of 495.54 for the day, indicating a strong bullish momentum and positive sentiment towards the stock. Conversely, if Meta cannot hold the 483.11 level as support, bears might target a move down to 480.96. A continuation of the bearish trend could lead to a test of 479.47. With sustained selling, the next level to watch is 477.50, marking the low bear target for the day. This level represents a significant bearish stance if reached, highlighting potential downside risks for Meta. Tesla Inc. Tesla&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) is currently navigating around the key level of 200.43. Bulls aim for an upward push to 201.85, with a potential rally towards 204.33. A bullish market trend today could lead to testing higher levels at 206.71. If there is significant buying interest, Tesla could reach the high bull target of 209.51 for the day, indicating a strong bullish momentum and positive market outlook. However, if Tesla fails to maintain support at 200.43, bears might aim for a downward move to 197.50. Continued selling could bring the price down to 195.91. If bearish pressure continues, the next target is 193.81, marking the low bear target for the day. Achieving this level would highlight a significant bearish trend for Tesla, indicating potential downside risks. Final Word: The market is bracing for volatility with the upcoming release of the second GDP reading for Q4 and the Core PCE Price Index in the premarket session.

Before glossing over this piece, since it s not as appealing as discussing A.I. or the unquantifiable tangible market for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), it s important to note that the dynamics of the agricultural markets at this juncture have key economic impacts, including on inflation. So, buckle up, buttercup; we re hitting the countryside in today s note. Let s kick it off with the basics. The top U.S. agricultural products, in nominal dollars, are: Live Cattle, Corn, Soybeans, Lean Hogs, and, to a lesser extent, Wheat post the Ukraine/Russia conflict. Live Cattle is obviously a staple within the U.S. diet when it comes to beef consumption, as it is one of the traditional sources of protein on a cultural basis. A smaller portion of this agricultural group is used for dairy production and breeding. Maintaining cattle production has become very difficult post-pandemic as input costs have risen exponentially, from feed to continued drought conditions. Ranchers have resorted to significantly reducing supply growth rates and focusing on weight to maximize margins. Drought conditions, as we will mention several times, are one of the major factors affecting every product. The corn market has seen significant downside pressure since the highs of 2022 because of oversupply, but also due to increased competition from overseas competitors like Brazil and Argentina, who have expanded their corn production on a relatively exponential basis. Contrary to popular belief, most of the U.S. corn crop is consumed domestically, and it s not the delicious, sweet corn we enjoy at the dinner table. Most U.S. corn is used for livestock feed &mdash; although it is inferior to its protein-rich counterpart, soybeans &mdash; and for ethanol production. Foreign buyers have diversified their corn purchases to include Argentina and Brazil, moving away from the U.S.-produced crop, pushing prices down while planting costs continue to elevate, squeezing margins. This year, U.S. farmers are keeping an eye on production from Argentina and Brazil, as it is expected that their crop yields may further expand global inventories. However, weather stresses could dramatically change the pricing structure in the U.S. s favor. In a sense, food inflation rests on these two South American powerhouses. Crop failure or lower-than-expected yields from these two producers will reignite the bullish thesis on corn prices. The king crop around the globe, soybeans, faces similar headwinds as corn but with one caveat: China. Soybeans are considered by most within the ag space as the &quot;miracle&quot; crop because of their nutritional properties, durability in weather events, relatively low cost to grow, and their application as an all-around crop. Soybean is more nutritional than corn in relation to feedstock due to its protein properties and its ability to provide other essential nutrients like fiber and vitamins, and so rightfully, it goes for a premium compared to corn. Also, the applications for human consumption as soy products hold significant cultural standing and renewed interest across the globe. China has experienced some turbulence while ending COVID lockdowns, and as a result, the demand for Soybean &amp; Soybean Meal has been lackluster until recently. Over the last 2 months, China has ramped up their soybean orders, which is a good start for the global markets, but once again, they re diversifying their purchases to expand outside of the main U.S. market and opting for producers in, as you may have guessed, Argentina and Brazil. One of the main takeaways is the fact that South America has ramped up production of grains across the board, and this has now put pressure on U.S. agricultural products, squeezing margins for U.S. farmers and ranchers. That being said, weather events in South America have put some of these growth prospects at risk. Drought conditions in northern Brazil and excessive rains in certain parts of Argentina have stressed crop yields, but the market is unsure as to the extent. So, until we have a clear picture, grain prices continue to be depressed. In the U.S., a different dynamic is taking shape right before the planting season. An abnormally warm winter has actually pushed up the prospects for an early planting season, which is naturally bearish for markets, but the caveat is the already excessive drought conditions within the corn belt, especially in Iowa and the southwest plains. This could result in crops being planted early and at risk of any reemergence of arctic behavior or excessive rains before the crops take root, washing away a considerable portion of the crop. The projected seasonal temperature and precipitation outlook by the National Weather Service may put additional stress on domestic crop and livestock producers who are already experiencing tight margins. For many, the only way to expand margins is to reduce supply in this environment, and we are early enough in the season where these adjustments could be made. Nevertheless, if you ever get a chance, please thank a farmer and/or a rancher. With compressed margins, increased foreign competition, and the stress of the most unpredictable precious natural resource on earth, water, they have some tough decisions to make in the next 45 days: preserve margins or maximize production. The Fed is assuming producers will sacrifice margins countertrend to our European and South American counterparts. If you were in their shoes, what would you choose? Something to keep your eye on.

What Happened: Smead, the founder of Smead Capital Management, has been vocal about the potential risks associated with the current market climate, reported Business Insider. He believes that investors are underestimating the dangers of the AI frenzy and the over-reliance on the Magnificent Seven stocks, which have been propelling the S&amp;P 500 to record highs. He cautioned that the market s current state is reminiscent of previous bubbles, and history suggests a major correction could be on the horizon. Smead highlighted the Nifty Fifty stocks of the 60s and 70s, which plummeted during the 1973 market crash, and the fate of Cisco and Intel, two prominent stocks during the dot-com bubble that lost over half their value. Notably, Smead s concerns echo those of other market experts who have drawn parallels between the current AI craze and the dot-com bubble. Despite the differences in market valuations, Smead believes a significant market fallout could still be imminent.  We have no urge to go through purgatory with popular stocks that lead to long-term heartache. This mania appears to be headed to a bad ending. As always, fear stock market failure,  Smead said. See Also: Floki Sets New Record With $105M Staked, Surges Ahead Of Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, Shiba Inu In Total Locked Value Why It Matters: Smead s warning adds to the growing chorus of voices expressing concern over the current market situation. Renowned finance professor Jeremy Siegel recently raised a red flag over the soaring valuations of technology stocks, particularly NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), suggesting that a speculative bubble might be forming. On the other hand, some experts like John Higgins, the chief markets economist at Capital Economics, have forecasted that the current stock market bubble will continue to inflate until the end of 2025, driven by the narrative around artificial intelligence. Smead s warning echoes concerns raised by other market commentators, including J.P. Morgan strategists  who have drawn comparisons between the current market and the dot-com bubble era. The analysts noted that despite the  irrational exuberance  of the dot-com bubble, there are many similarities between the two periods. However, Smead s warning suggests that despite the potential economic benefits of AI, investors should remain cautious about the sustainability of the current market boom.

","Jeremy Siegel, a renowned finance professor from the University of Pennsylvania s Wharton School, has raised a red flag over the soaring valuations of technology stocks, particularly NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). What Happened: Siegel, also known as the  Wizard of Wharton,  cautioned that the current enthusiasm for tech stocks, including Nvidia, might be a sign of an impending bubble, reported Business Insider.  The beginnings of a speculative bubble may be forming but it is impossible to tell when it will end,  Siegel said in his weekly WisdomTree commentary on Monday. He noted that Nvidia s stock has surged more than five times since the beginning of last year, propelling the company s market value to $2 trillion, surpassing giants like Amazon and Alphabet. The demand for its graphics chips from AI companies has driven a 265% year-on-year revenue increase to over $22 billion in the last quarter. Siegel, who had correctly predicted last year s stock-market rally, suggested that the current tech-stock surge might eventually halt, leading to a potentially severe correction. See Also: Donald Trump s Mar-a-Lago Co-Defendant Carlos De Oliveira Requests Dismissal Of Charges In Classified Doc Despite the mounting concerns about the U.S. economy, Siegel remains optimistic, citing low unemployment, strong job gains, and persistent inflation as positive indicators. Why It Matters: Siegel s warning comes amid a growing chorus of voices expressing concerns about a potential tech bubble. Just last week, J.P. Morgan strategists flagged similarities between the current market conditions and the dot-com bubble, raising concerns about extreme valuations. Moreover, Apollo Global Management s chief economist, Torsten Sløk, recently warned that the current AI bubble is even larger than the 1990s tech bubble, citing higher forward price-to-earnings ratios for the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500. However, not all experts share these concerns. Earlier this month, tech venture capitalist Gene Munster dismissed fears of an imminent AI bubble burst, asserting that we are at the beginning of a 3-5-year tech run.

However, according to DataTrek, today s mega-cap stocks are likely to weather the current higher rate environment. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 65.8 Eli Lilly And Company (NYSE:LLY) even higher at 131 Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), with a gigantic 334 See the chart below. DataTrek puts the current average Shiller p/e of 34.1 into some context. The Fed s aggressive rate cycle in 2022 and 2023 did not fundamentally spook equities anywhere near as much as what happened in the 1970s, the data firm noted.  The yield volatility of the 1970s, driven first by rampant inflation and then the Fed s response, cast a long shadow. It took stocks decades to get past those events,  it added. During the 1970s and 1980s, Treasury yield volatility increased. Ten-year rates hit 16% in 1981, before falling back to 9% in 1990 as inflation skyrocketed during two oil crises. In response, Shiller p/e average fell to just 11x in the 1980s.  Uncertainty surrounding long-term interest rates has had a profound effect on equity valuations over the last 50 years,  DataTrek analysts said.

Inflation s Stickiest Mile To 2% Target While there s some argument now about whether the Fed funds rate should be at 4%, 5% or 6%, that is nothing compared to the 5%, 10% or even 15% rates hit during the past four decades.  There is increasing chatter that the Fed may need to put off rate cuts year or even tweak policy rates higher to fully bring inflation to heel, but historical records suggest this may not hit equity valuations as much as one might think.  However, if the Fed were to raise to 8%, 9% or 10%, and 10-year yields reset to those levels, that would be a 1970s-style problem,  the DataTrek analysts concluded.

Leading chipmakers, including&nbsp;Nvidia Corp&nbsp;and&nbsp;Advanced Micro Devices, Inc&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AMD), have earned breakthroughs in AI technology chips courtesy of the U.S. and global Big Tech companies splurging on expanding their AI moat. Analysts tout the chip designers as the key AI beneficiaries. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo highlighted this surge in interest, emphasizing the government s role in revitalizing the nation s semiconductor manufacturing to mitigate reliance on foreign chip production.&nbsp; Currently, the U.S. only produces 12% of global chips, a figure the subsidies aim to increase by incentivizing domestic production to strengthen the U.S. supply chain, the New York Times&nbsp;reports. The urgency for expanding domestic chip production is further amplified by the rise of artificial intelligence, deemed a pivotal technology of the era by Raimondo. Citi&nbsp;analyst Christopher Danely AMD and Nvidia are amongst his top AI picks. He expects broader semiconductor revenue growth of at least 11% YoY in 2024, given that units, declined 19% in 2023, the most significant decline since 2001.

The company holds a positive outlook for its MI300X chip, predicting revenues to top its anticipated $2 billion in 2024. AMD believes it can challenge Nvidia in the inferencing sector, attributing its confidence to its extensive high-bandwidth memory (HBM) capacity. Moreover, AMD foresees further growth in its server CPU market share, supported by its collaboration with&nbsp;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co&nbsp;(NYSE:TSM). U.S. received over 600 expressions of interest, indicating a broad industry desire to enhance U.S. semiconductor capabilities, particularly in leading-edge technology predominantly produced in Taiwan.&nbsp; The CHIPS Act, facilitating this subsidy program, aims to expand manufacturing capacity and includes provisions for $11 billion in research funding to pioneer new chip technologies. This technology is crucial for various sectors, including AI and military hardware. The focus is on allocating approximately $28 billion towards developing these high-tech chips, a move aimed at increasing the U.S. s share of global advanced chip production from virtually none to around 20% by the decade s end. AMD stock has gained 27% year-to-date, reaching a market cap of over $284 billion. Nvidia gained over 64%. Amid Nvidia s significant stock price increase, concerns about its&nbsp;sustainability have emerged.

Note the following: The chart shows bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) broke out. RSI on the chart shows bitcoin has room to run.&nbsp;The severely overbought condition in bitcoin has been relieved by bitcoin being range bound for a few days. There is no resistance for bitcoin between here and $65,000. The rise in bitcoin seems to be triggered, in part, by a rumor that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) will start supporting bitcoin in its products.&nbsp;In The Arora Report analysis, at this time, there is no credibility to this rumor.&nbsp; More than likely, it is simply another tool used by whales to drive bitcoin higher.&nbsp; Having said that, stranger things have happened. Upcoming halving is also contributing to buying in bitcoin. The sharp rise in bitcoin is an indication of overall extreme positive sentiment in the market. The momentum in bitcoin could slow or even reverse if the market starts paying attention to anything other than momentum and AI. Bitcoin whales get investors excited about buying bitcoin, then whales tactically sell into the strength without slowing the rise. If momentum reverses, then whales sell aggressively. Bitcoin miners are being aggressively bought. This is a leading indicator. In The Arora Report analysis, the just released durable goods data shows weakening business spending.&nbsp;Here are the details: Headline durable orders came at -6.1% vs. -4.4% consensus.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Significant merger deals, including&nbsp;Nvidia Corp&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA)  &nbsp;Arm Holdings Plc&nbsp;(NASDAQ:ARM) and&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel Corp s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:INTC)  &nbsp;Tower Semiconductor Ltd&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSEM), succumbed to regulatory opposition over anticompetitive grounds. The European Union s competition watchdog plans to examine&nbsp;Microsoft Corp s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:MSFT)&nbsp;recent investment in&nbsp;Mistral AI, alongside its ongoing scrutiny of Microsoft s close relationship with&nbsp;OpenAI Inc. Microsoft has formed a strategic partnership with Mistral, investing €15 million ($16.3 million) to make Mistral s artificial intelligence models available on its Azure cloud platform.&nbsp; Unlike OpenAI s models, which are proprietary, Mistral s are open for sharing.&nbsp; This investment in Mistral, known for developing algorithmic models for AI services similar to those by OpenAI, will turn into equity in Mistral s next funding round, Bloomberg&nbsp;reports. While Microsoft has primarily collaborated with OpenAI, investing about $13 billion, its ties with OpenAI and its new investment in Mistral are closely watched by U.K. and EU regulators, raising concerns about potential formal investigations that could impact Microsoft s AI endeavors. Separately, the U.K. s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated a formal investigation into&nbsp;Qualcomm Inc s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:QCOM)&nbsp;acquisition of the&nbsp;Israeli semiconductor company&nbsp;Autotalks Ltd&nbsp;for terms undisclosed due to concerns that the deal might restrict competition in the market.&nbsp; The CMA has set a deadline of April 25 to determine whether to greenlight the acquisition or escalate it to a more detailed investigation, Bloomberg&nbsp;reports. Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, California, announced its intention to acquire Autotalks through its subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies Inc, aiming to enhance its portfolio in automotive safety systems, specifically in crash-prevention technology.&nbsp; Additionally, the European Union is examining the takeover, following requests from 15 EU member states, indicating significant regulatory scrutiny over the transaction s potential impact on competition.

In today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.","Good Morning Traders! In today s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA. Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market. We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY (NYSE:SPY) is currently being traded around the 506.71 mark. For those bullish on SPY, the initial target is a rise to 507.52. Should the market sustain momentum above this level, the next objective for buyers is to elevate the price to 508.34. A successful defense of 509.49 during the standard trading hours would set the stage for an advance beyond this threshold. The ultimate bullish goal for today in the SPY market is reaching 510.14. On the flip side, if the 506.71 level fails to serve as a reliable floor, the market may see a downward push towards 506.06, testing the resolve of the bears. A visible presence of sellers could further drag the price down to 505.32. Breaking below this level amidst intense selling could expose the next significant floor at 503.95. In the event of a marked sell-off today, the bearish boundary is set at 502.85. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ&nbsp;(NASDAQ:QQQ) is hovering around a pivotal point of 437.47. Bulls in the market are keen on sustaining levels above 437.47. Holding firm at this juncture could see a bullish push towards 438.89, establishing it as a new support level. Continued purchasing power might then target the 440.00 mark, with a strong trading session potentially challenging the 440.78 level. The peak bullish target for QQQ today is envisioned at 440.78. Conversely, if the QQQ struggles to maintain its stance above 437.47, it could signal a bearish takeover, prompting a descent to 436.58. Observing weakness at this level might compel bears to explore deeper at 435.88. Persistent seller activity could challenge the 434.76 support, with a failure to hold potentially leading to a dip towards the day s lowest bearish expectation at 433.64. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) current trading position is at 180.60. Bulls are eyeing this level as a base for support, hoping to propel the stock to 181.25. A continuation of bullish trends could push the price towards 182.27. Should Apple s bulls dominate the day s trading, the aim would be to surge past to a high target of 182.96. Should Apple s support at 180.60 falter, a bearish scenario could unfold, testing the waters at 180.10. A sustained sell-off might lower the price further to 179.36, and if the bearish momentum continues, 178.61 could come into play. In a significant downtrend, the day s lowest bear target for Apple is set at 178.18. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading around 407.11, with bulls hoping to maintain a foothold above this level. The initial bullish goal is to reach 408.46 and secure it as support within the trading day. A strong position above this key level could see the price aiming for 409.69, with the day s bullish peak targeted at 410.64. If Microsoft fails to secure support at 407.11, bears might test the lower boundary at 406.01. A breach of this level could lead to further bearish exploration towards 404.92. Continued downward pressure might push the stock towards 402.74, with the bearish extremity for the day marked at 401.39. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) finds itself at a critical juncture of 791.44. Bulls are encouraged by the prospect of advancing to 794.94, hoping to establish it as a solid support zone. An upward trajectory might see the stock reaching 799.10, with sustained buying potentially driving it up to 804.61. The zenith for NVIDIA bulls today is set at 810.13. However, if NVIDIA s support at 791.44 shows weakness, bears might aim for a decline to 787.68. A confirmation of seller dominance could see the price retracting to 785.35. In a softer market, the next level to watch is 781.59, with the ultimate bearish target for the day lying at 778.91. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) trading activity is centered around 138.39. Bulls are looking to anchor support at 139.46, aspiring to push the stock to 140.05. With sustained bullish momentum, the trajectory could extend to a high target of 140.57. Conversely, if Alphabet cannot maintain support at 138.39, bears might press the price down to 137.79. Failing to uphold this level could see a further dip to 136.94. In the face of aggressive selling, the lowest bearish aim for the day is 136.29. Meta Platforms Inc Meta Platforms&nbsp;(NASDAQ:META) is navigating the market at 480.96. Bulls are aiming to solidify this level as a base, pushing for an upward move to 483.11. A robust buying spree could elevate the stock to 485.96, with the ultimate bullish horizon for the day set at 488.81. Should Meta fail to cling to the 480.96 support, a bearish tilt could lead to a test of 479.47. Persistent selling pressure might drag the price further down to 477.50. In a scenario of pronounced bearish momentum, the day s final bear target is 475.19. Tesla Inc. Tesla s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) current market position is at 201.85. Bulls are eyeing an upward push to 204.33, with a strong market potentially elevating Tesla to 206.71. An overarching bullish sentiment in the broader market could see Tesla challenging 209.51, with the day s pinnacle bull target at 211.53. If Tesla s support at 201.85 proves fragile, the market might explore lower territories, starting at 200.43. Persistent selling could see a further retraction to 197.50, and if the bearish drive continues, a drop to the day s lowest target of 193.81 is anticipated. Final Word: Today s trading landscape is dotted with significant data releases, including the House Price Purchase Index and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, alongside Consumer Confidence figures. The afternoon will bring insights from a 7 Year Note Auction by the US Treasury. Remarks from influential figures like Fed Vice Char Barr and Yellen are also on the agenda, potentially stirring market volatility.

Until around a month ago, you could still take odds at around 3/1 that the first cut would come in March. Now almost certainly off the table, May or June come into focus for the first downward move. But a sticky consumer price inflation number for January and stronger-than-expected labor market data, followed by hawkish Fed comments at the last Open Market Committee meeting, have led some to push expectations back to the July meeting. And what if between now and then, the inflation data begin to show further stickiness. There are plenty of outliers that haven t yet been seen in the official data. Supply Chain And Wage Growth Risks Outliers such as the impact of longer lead times and higher shipping costs on goods and raw materials because of longer shipping routes as freight avoids the Red Sea.  Red Sea tensions have started to impact freight costs, which could lead to more general supply-chain pressures that were a major cause of the inflation surge in 2022,  said Jeremy De Pessemier, strategist at the World Gold Council. Wage inflation could also present an outlier risk as the labor market remains tight, with strong levels of job creation and low levels of layoffs continuing into what was supposed to be the latter part of the current business cycle.  If labor demand remains strong on the back of strong nominal spending, there can be a non-linear increase in nominal wages that can feed into service inflation,  said Claudio Irigoyen, analyst at Bank of America. The above chart shows the iShares Russell 2000 ETF against both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices Also Read: Fed Minutes Stress Inflation Vigilance, Push Back Earlier Rate Cut Moves Despite these uncertainties — including fiscal policy challenges as the government repeatedly delays the federal budget plan, and the looming presidential election — the economy has proven to be much more resilient than many anticipated six months ago.  The path back to target inflation, as much as a path to a soft landing, was always likely to be bumpy and narrow,  said De Pessemier. While the market is still priced for several rate cuts in 2024 and more to come in 2025, the risk of a further upward surprise in inflation cannot be ruled out given the potential outlying threats.  The market might be wrong, as much as it was wrong in completely underestimating inflation and overestimating the slowdown of the economy. And to be fair, the Fed, by delaying the tightening cycle by one year, was in the same camp,  said Irigoyen. Meanwhile, a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses survey of small companies asked 10,000 firms if they plan to increase selling prices over the next three months. ""The recent acceleration in the share of firms saying yes suggests that CPI inflation could increase over the coming months,"" said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. How Would Markets React? So what would this mean for markets? If the Fed were to further delay cuts beyond May and June, the equity market rally could potentially fade and go into reverse. This would likely be led by losses for small- and mid-cap companies — those that require loans for growth opportunities, that become more difficult to service, the longer rates remain higher. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), an exchange traded fund that tracks the small-cap index, has stalled in 2024 after a strong two months during November and December, when hopes were still high of a March rate cut. Highly indebted tech stocks and non-dividend payers might also share the brunt of an equity sell off. Stocks in the Magnificent Seven, such as Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), which have been at the forefront of the rally, could find profits taking hits. The dollar, which has gained in 2024 on fading hopes of a March cut, would find further support the longer rate cut expectations are pushed back. The Invesco Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP) has gained 3.3% so far in 2024. A higher dollar is broadly a bad thing for gold. The higher the rate of the U.S. currency, the more expensive dollar-denominated gold is to buy in other currencies. After a surge to record highs in December, the price of gold has broadly traded sideways, between the $2,000 and $2,100 levels. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:GLD) has tracked this performance. Oil markets tend to respond to wider economic developments and geopolitics. Thus, if higher inflation were to prompt tougher consumer conditions and a fall in demand, prices would be hit. Such considerations are currently being balanced by the potential for geopolitical developments in the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine. The United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSE:USO) is up nearly 10% so far in 2024. Read Now: Biden Calls In Budget Big Guns: But What Happens If Government Shutdown Can t Be Avoided?

Several telecom companies and AI leaders including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) launched the AI-RAN Alliance at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday. The initiative aims to unlock new opportunities for telecom companies through AI. Traders appear to be bidding up SoundHound stock following the announcement.

These efforts followed Broadcom s acquisition of the businesses through its $61 billion takeover of VMware Inc in November. In November 2023, a leaked email revealed Broadcom s plans to review  strategic alternatives  of two of VMware s business units. Recent reports indicated that Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding into custom AI chip design, directly challenging Broadcom in the custom silicon market. Nvidia aims to utilize its stronghold in the high-end AI chip sector, which controls about 80% of the market, to penetrate a burgeoning field. This strategic shift, driven by the growing trend of tech giants like OpenAI and Microsoft towards bespoke chips, threatens Broadcom s market share in the data center custom silicon, valued at approximately $30 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan s annual pay surged to $161.8 million last year, mainly due to a $160.5 million stock award set to vest over five years, marking a 167% jump in his total compensation. While his salary remained at $1.2 million in 2023, the absence of non-equity incentive compensation, which previously added $5.4 million, was noted.&nbsp; Broadcom described the substantial stock award as  front-loaded,  indicating no further annual equity awards during the vesting period, Bloomberg&nbsp;reports.&nbsp; This increase reflects the company s recognition of Tan s pivotal role in transforming Broadcom into a leading infrastructure technology company, leveraging strategic acquisitions such as VMware Inc, CA Technologies, and Symantec Corp s corporate security business. Additionally, Charlie Kawwas, head of Broadcom s semiconductor division, saw his compensation rise to $49.7 million in 2023, primarily through a similar $48.2 million award. Broadcom stock gained 21% year-to-date and Nvidia over 64%. Price Action: AVGO shares are trading higher by 0.26% at $1,312.50 premarket on the last check Tuesday.

I would argue that the bearish implications of weaker breadth, along with bearish divergences and overbought conditions, still remain largely unchanged even after NVDA&rsquo;s earnings report.&nbsp;The seasonality charts for the S&amp;P 500 confirm that March is in fact one of the weakest months in an election year.&nbsp;So will the Nasdaq 100 follow the normal seasonal pattern, or will the strength of the AI euphoria push this market to even further heights into Q2? By the way, we conducted a similar exercise for the Nasdaq 100 back in November, and guess which scenario actually played out? Today, we&rsquo;ll lay out four potential outcomes for the Nasdaq 100.&nbsp;As I share each of these four future paths, I&rsquo;ll describe the market conditions that would likely be involved and I&rsquo;ll also share my estimated probability for each scenario.&nbsp; And remember, the point of this exercise is threefold: Consider all four potential future paths for the index, think about what would cause each scenario to unfold in terms of the macro drivers, and review what signals/patterns/indicators would confirm the scenario. Decide which scenario you feel is most likely, and why you think that s the case. Don t forget to drop me a comment and let me know your vote! Think about how each of the four scenarios would impact your current portfolio. How would you manage risk in each case? How and when would you take action to adapt to this new reality? Let s start with the most optimistic scenario, involving even more all-time highs over the next six to eight weeks. Option 1: The Very Bullish Scenario The most optimistic scenario from here would mean the Nasdaq basically continues its current trajectory.&nbsp;That would mean another 7-10% gain into April, the QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ)&nbsp;would be threatening the $500 level, and leading growth stocks would continue to lead in a big way.&nbsp; Nvidia&rsquo;s strong earnings release fueled additional buying, and the market doesn&rsquo;t much care about what the Fed says at its March meeting because life is just that good. In this very bullish scenario, value-oriented stocks including Industrials, Energy, and Financials would probably move higher in this scenario as well but would still probably lag the growth leadership that would pound even higher. Dave&rsquo;s vote: 15% Option 2: The Mildly Bullish Scenario What if the market remains elevated, but the pace slows way down?&nbsp; This second scenario would mean that the Magnificent 7 stocks would take a big-time breather, and more of a leadership rotation begins to take place.&nbsp; Value stocks outperform as Industrials and Health Care stocks improve, but since the mega cap growth names don&rsquo;t lose too much value, our benchmarks remain pretty close to current levels. Dave&rsquo;s vote: 25% Option 3: The Mildly Bearish Scenario Both of the bearish scenarios would involve a pullback in leading growth names, and stocks like NVDA would quickly give back some of their recent gains.&nbsp; Perhaps some economic data comes in way stronger than expected, or inflation signals revert back higher, and the Fed starts reiterating the &ldquo;higher for longer&rdquo; approach to interest rates through 2024.&nbsp; I would think of this mildly bearish scenario as meaning the QQQ remains above the first Fibonacci support level just above $400.&nbsp; That level is based on the October 2023 low and also assumes that the Nasdaq doesn&rsquo;t get much higher than current levels before dropping a bit.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t see defensive sectors like Utilities outperforming, but it&rsquo;s clear that stocks are taking a serious break from the AI mania of early 2024. Dave&rsquo;s vote: 45% Option 4: The Super Bearish Scenario Now we get to the really scary option, where this week&rsquo;s upswing ends up being a blowoff rally, and stocks flip from bullish to bearish with a sudden and surprising strength.&nbsp; The QQQ drops about 10-15% from current levels and retests the price gap from November 2023, which would represent a 61.8% retracement of the recent upswing.&nbsp; Defensive sectors outperform as investors try to find safe havens as the market tracks its traditional seasonal pattern, perhaps gold finally breaks above $2,000 per ounce, and investors start to talk about how a break below the October 2023 low may be just the beginning of a new bearish phase.

What Happened: Samsung has unveiled a new high-bandwidth memory chip, the HBM3E 12H, which the company claims has the  highest capacity to date  in the industry, reported CNBC. This new chip is expected to significantly enhance the performance and capacity of AI systems. Yongcheol Bae, the executive vice president of memory product planning at Samsung Electronics, stated,  The industry s AI service providers are increasingly requiring HBM with higher capacity, and our new HBM3E 12H product has been designed to answer that need.  Bae added,  This new memory solution forms part of our drive toward developing core technologies for high-stack HBM and providing technological leadership for the high-capacity HBM market in the AI era.  The HBM3E 12H chip is a significant addition to Samsung s portfolio, considering its position as the world s largest producer of dynamic random-access memory chips, which are utilized in consumer devices such as smartphones and computers. ""As AI applications grow exponentially, the HBM3E 12H is expected to be an optimal solution for future systems that require more memory. Its higher performance and capacity will especially allow customers to manage their resources more flexibly and reduce total cost of ownership for datacenters,"" said Samsung Electronics. See Also: Trump Vs. Biden: Poll Shows One Candidate Holding Slim Advantage Over Another In Hypothetical Matchup ""I assume the news will be positive for Samsung's share price,"" SK Kim, executive director of Daiwa Securities said, according to the report. Why It Matters: The AI industry is experiencing a surge in demand for high-performance memory chips, driven by the increasing use of generative AI models like OpenAI s ChatGPT. This trend has been a boon for chipmakers, with companies like Nvidia witnessing a significant rise in revenue. Earlier in the month, Samsung announced a collaboration with Arm Holdings to develop the next-generation Arm Cortex-X CPU using Samsung Foundry's latest Gate-All-Around (GAA) process technology. This partnership aims to introduce significant innovations in the semiconductor industry, including an AI chipset solution targeting the generative AI mobile computing market. However, Samsung s strategic moves in the chipmaking industry have not been limited to partnerships and product launches. The company recently divested its entire remaining stake in ASML Holding during the December quarter, marking a strategic move to diversify and expand its footprint in the chipmaking industry. Furthermore, Samsung s investment in a new advanced chip packaging research facility in Japan is another step in the company s efforts to boost its chipmaking capabilities amid the global tech race. These strategic moves, combined with the latest chip launch, underscore Samsung s commitment to maintaining its position as a key player in the semiconductor industry.

He recently expressed his enthusiasm for the company&#39;s performance.","Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) has emerged as a top pick in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware sector, overshadowing industry giant NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), according to veteran investor Louis Navellier. What Happened: Navellier, the founder and chairman of Navellier &amp; Associates, has been a long-time investor in Super Micro Computer. He recently expressed his enthusiasm for the company s performance, telling CNBC s  Street Signs Asia  that Super Micro Computer is currently outshining Nvidia in the AI hardware market. ""Super Micro is hotter than Nvidia. And the reason they're hotter is they got it higher – they beat their guidance. And it's not in the S&amp;P 500 right now. They'll probably be added,"" Navellier said. Super Micro Computer, a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in AI systems and graphics processing unit servers, has seen its shares soar by over 200% this year, while Nvidia s shares have risen by 59%. See Also:  Dogecoin Killer  Shiba Inu Witnesses Massive 421.6B Token Move By Whale, Resulting In $6M+ Loss Navellier advises investors interested in the AI trend to consider hardware stocks, with Super Micro Computer and Nvidia being the dominant players. He also believes that Super Micro Computer s stock is not overpriced, a sentiment echoed by Wall Street analysts. Bank of America emphasized Super Micro Computer s underutilized potential in mid-February, pointing out its expanding backlog and growing capacity. It has a price target of $1,040, which represents a 21% upside, and a buy rating. Super Micro Computer received a 71% buy recommendation from analysts covering the company, according to FactSet data. Why It Matters: Navellier s endorsement of Super Micro Computer comes at a time when the AI hardware market is experiencing significant shifts. Just days before Navellier s comments, Nvidia identified Huawei Technologies as a major rival in the AI chip market. This acknowledgment of Huawei s growing influence in AI hardware, despite ongoing chip constraints, underscores the dynamic nature of the sector. Navellier s assessment of Super Micro Computer also contrasts with warnings from other industry figures about the sustainability of the current market rally. John Hussman, the president of the Hussman Investment Trust, has cautioned that the market s  fear of missing out  FOMO rally could lead to a prolonged period of low returns, casting doubt on the long-term prospects of the AI-driven market surge. Navellier s endorsement of Super Micro Computer comes at a time when the tech industry is under scrutiny for potential overvaluation. The recent surge in tech stocks, particularly in the AI and hardware sectors, has raised concerns about a possible market bubble, with some analysts drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. Despite these concerns, Navellier s confidence in Super Micro Computer suggests that there may still be solid investment opportunities in the tech sector.

What Happened: On Monday, Cramer named Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY), Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) as potential candidates for the trillion-dollar market cap, reported CNBC. ""There is no next Nvidia — it's what we call at law school sui generis — and you might not see another story this strong for a generation,"" he said, while also mentioning that there are other companies ""that can break through the $1 trillion barrier and while they're not as exciting as Nvidia, a few of them come pretty darned close."" He highlighted Eli Lilly as a strong contender, with a current market cap of over $730 billion according to FactSet. Cramer believes the company s value could skyrocket due to the potential of its GLP-1 drugs, which are currently used to treat diabetes and obesity. There is also ongoing research on their effectiveness in treating cardiovascular and liver diseases. Berkshire Hathaway, valued at over $905 billion, and Tesla, with a market cap of over $611 billion according to FactSet, were also mentioned as potential candidates. Cramer suggested that the rising cost of auto insurance could drive Berkshire Hathaway s value even higher. He also noted that Tesla s value could increase with the release of new models, but he sees it as less likely to reach the trillion-dollar mark.

If so, it could be necessary for Nvidia to pass the $5 trillion threshold before Broadcom does. $1 trillion mark. Why It Matters: The trillion-dollar market cap is a significant milestone for any company, signifying its immense size and influence in the global market. Nvidia recently achieved this feat, becoming the fourth company in the world to do so, after Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco. Earlier in February, Warren Buffet s Berkshire Hathaway was closing in on the trillion-dollar mark as its Class A shares surpassed $600,000 for the first time. This further underscores the significance of the trillion-dollar market cap and the companies that are on the brink of achieving it. Despite the current market uncertainties, as highlighted by Cramer, these companies  potential for reaching the trillion-dollar mark reflects their resilience and strength in the face of economic challenges.

He pointed out specific companies that have outperformed Wall Street s projections, offering a glimmer of hope amid market uncertainties. What Happened: On Monday, Cramer highlighted the success stories of several companies, including Domino s Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW), reported CNBC. Domino s Pizza, despite the challenging economic environment, saw its stock rise by 5.85% following better-than-expected earnings. Cramer attributed this surge to investors underestimating the company s resilience. Palo Alto Networks, which had previously revised its annual guidance, experienced a 7.33% increase in its stock price. Cramer suggested that this rise could be linked to an ongoing security breach at UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH). He also emphasized the ability of companies to quickly adapt and reinvent themselves, citing the recent turnarounds of retailers such as Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL), and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS).

Stocks are going up on rational experience, they re not going up on irrational, and they re not going up on the dreaded multiple expansion, where people keep paying more for the same earnings.  Why It Matters: Cramer s insights come at a time when the market is experiencing a mix of optimism and caution. The market has seen a record-breaking rally in 2024, with some analysts suggesting that it could be the best year since 1999. However, this has also led to a shift in sentiment towards caution, with traders potentially pausing for a breather after last week s robust gains. Earlier in the year, Cramer had urged investors to capitalize on market anomalies for profitable investments, pointing out that the market had defied conventional wisdom over the past two years. He also advised investors to look beyond the Magnificent Seven tech stocks for potential high-yield investments. During the first earnings season of 2024, Cramer also commended companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for their impressive financial reports, emphasizing the need for a longer-term vision in the market. Wall Street exhibited a subdued trend to start the week, with major indices showing little change.

After recently profiting more than $1 million from a trade in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Pelosi filed a new disclosure of a recent technology stock purchased by her and her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi. What Happened: The Pelosis bought call options in cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) before and after recent second-quarter financial results. According to a disclosure shared by Quiver Quant, the purchases were as follows: 50 call options PANW, strike price $200, expiration date Jan. 17, 2025, trade placed on Feb. 12 20 call options PANW, strike price $200, expiration date Jan. 17, 2025, trade placed on Feb. 21 Both trades were disclosed on Feb. 23 by Pelosi.

The purchase also came before Pelosi travelled to Taiwan. The Pelosis later sold their Nvidia shares at a loss missing out on millions of dollars in profit, with the trade potentially coming due to public pressure on the timing of the trade. Pelosi, who was formerly Speaker of the House, has said that she does not share information with her husband about government contracts or pending legislation that could be used for stock and options trades. While Palo Alto Networks has gotten government contracts in the past, the signing of future contracts coming after the disclosed trade by Pelosi could be heavily scrutinized.

The analyst happened to be in Cambridge recently and came away with increased conviction that royalty trends are rising at a faster clip on the heels of more strategic licensing engagements that are increasingly AI-centric. Mosesmann noted double-digit rates, up from the current mid-single digits, hitting the model by the end of the decade (up from his previous assumption of early next decade), shifting the model aggressively to over 80% royalties. Also Read:&nbsp;Intel Outlines Future in Foundry and Process Leadership, Analyst Sees Steady Performance ARM s P/E multiple is supportive of 50%+ levels given secular and royalty shifts at ~10% by the end of the decade, if not sooner, the analyst writes&nbsp; He said that, like&nbsp;Nvidia Corp&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) in computing GPUs, Arm s technology is becoming more indispensable as AI moves to the Edge. The analyst noted Arm s earnings power north of $3.00 in fiscal 2026.&nbsp; The move to the new v9 architecture (2x the royalty rate of v8) is by the Street being digested after the recent beat and raise. In addition, the computing subsystem (CSS) program is becoming an incredibly successful market thrust that shaves off as much as a year from engagement to silicon.&nbsp; Time-to-silicon has become a crucial dynamic on AI accelerated schedules amidst increasing front-end silicon at leading-edge nodes (over 20% per node), per the analyst. A top-tier customer saved 80 engineering years with CSS. CSS is a system-ready bundle with reference S/W stack, lead node, and RTL validated and pre-tuned vs. raw ARM physical IP delivery.&nbsp; CSS is a mid-single digit royalty rate adder to existing royalty rate levels, Mosesmann said. The analyst does not expect Softbank or ARM to make another offering anytime soon. He is intrigued by Arm s work on running mobile AI models without acceleration, which points to existing Android platforms running on Arm 700 series CPU cores. Quite interestingly, Arm CEO Rene Hass was invited on stage for the&nbsp;Intel Corp&nbsp;(NASDAQ:INTC) Foundry event as a partner for future Intel process node support, Mosesmann flagged.&nbsp; As a historical competitor for Intel, the critical takeaway is that the Intel IFS is likely impossible without Arm support, given the ubiquity going forward. This is leverage per the analyst. The analyst projects fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $875 million and $0.30. Price Action:&nbsp;ARM shares traded higher by 10.50% at $147.40 on the last check Monday.

Record Cash Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of&nbsp;Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE: BRK-B). Note the following: This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock.&nbsp;The chart of BRK.B is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows that BRK.B is jumping up this morning after slightly beating earnings estimates. The chart shows that after the breakout, BRK.B has continued to power up. The chart shows the move up in BRK.B stock is accelerating. RSI on the chart shows that the Berkshire rally may not go much farther. In The Arora Report analysis, the following are the key points from Berkshire earnings that all investors should pay attention to: Berkshire is sitting on record cash, $167.7B. Warren Buffett sees more deals than anyone else, but he still cannot find a large company to buy. This indicates that this market is expensive. Buffett has said that he is price conscious when buying back BRK.B stock.&nbsp;Buffett seems to be slowing down the pace of BRK.B buybacks.&nbsp;This indicates that Buffett views BRK.B as expensive.&nbsp;As of February 12, BRK.B has only bought $600M of its stock vs. $2.2B buybacks in the prior quarter. BRK.B stock is now priced at 1.6 times book value vs. an average of 1.4 times book value over the last five years.&nbsp;This indicates that BRK.B stock is expensive. BRK.B stock now trades at a forward PE of 24.&nbsp;This again indicates that BRK.B stock is expensive. The chart shows that the market sentiment is so positive that investors are buying BRK.B stock and paying no attention to valuation.&nbsp;In The Arora Report analysis, this pattern is being repeated in many popular stocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an economic data heavy week.&nbsp;Most important is PCE data.&nbsp;PCE is the Fed&rsquo;s favorite inflation gauge.&nbsp; PCE will be reported on February 29 at 8:30am ET.&nbsp;The consensus 0.4% for both core and the headline. In The Arora Report analysis, there is a high probability that inflation, as measured by PCE, increased by the highest amount in a year.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a heavy supply of Treasury auctions this week. Here is the key question for investors: &ldquo;Will the extremely positive sentiment and AI frenzy overcome the economic data, high valuations, and heavy Treasury borrowing?&rdquo; As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp;If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave like no other, and now he has revealed the secret sauce of the tools he uses for research purposes every day. What Happened: Huang revealed the two research tools he uses ""almost every day"" — Perplexity AI and Microsoft Corp.-backed (NASDAQ:MSFT) OpenAI's ChatGPT. Coincidentally, both tools use Nvidia hardware. Huang revealed this in an interview with Wired, underlining the popularity of ChatGPT as well as the recent rise of Perplexity. While Perplexity is Huang's first preference, ChatGPT also found a mention amongst Huang's research tools. Interestingly enough, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini (previously Bard) was missing from the list. ""I've been using Perplexity. I enjoy ChatGPT as well. I use both almost every day,"" said Huang.

And so you want to frame the overall topic so that you could have a framework, and from that framework, you could ask more and more specific questions.""

","Tech Boom Bond Bust Nvidia&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered the goods, overwhelming a series of hawkish Fed speeches and FOMC January 30-31 meeting minutes that led to another 10bp in yield across the Treasury curve through Thursday&rsquo;s close, bringing the move from the late December lows on nominal 10s to over 50bp. Issuance was primarily bills, but the two coupon auctions, 20-year nominals and 30-year TIPS, were poorly received. Next week brings $63 billion of 2s, up from $60 billion last month, $64 billion of 5s, from $61 billion in January and $42 billion of 7s, last month&rsquo;s $41 billion auction. With net coupon issuance set to increase by greater than $500 billion in coming months, and California&rsquo;s revenue shortfall potentially portending a second consecutive federal government tax season shortfall, we suspect the Treasury market needs to back up further to absorb growing supply. Meanwhile, with FOMC participants sending an unequivocal message that conditions are not in place for policy easing, it seems likely the brief period of bank interest in the belly of the Treasury curve following the November pause and December pivot party, is over. Additionally, with the Fed delaying cuts, the associated strength in the dollar implies the December foreign buying of USTs (which we highlighted in a chart last week at the end of our note) won&rsquo;t persist either. The methodical grind higher in rates and near disinversion of the 2s10s real rate curve is far from a high velocity tightening of financial conditions sufficient to cause a risk-off episode across asset classes. The real curve is bear steepening, which is typically not a favorable backdrop for risky assets. However, given that the move higher in 10-year nominals and TIPS is only a bit above 38.2% Fibonacci retracements of the Treasury reduced coupon issuance and Fed pause 4Q23 rally, the pace will have to accelerate and rates will have to move to at least above 4.5% and 2.25% respectively for negative bond returns to reverberate across other asset classes. For investors (ourselves included) who are invested in the technology and related sectors Gen AI theme, or in the manufacturing renaissance or energy sector consolidation themes, the market implied delay in easing policy from March to June matters little. However, as evidenced by the widening of the spread of mortgage-backed securities and the associated increase in fixed income implied volatility, the timing matters a great deal to fixed income investors. Consequently, financials, particularly smaller spread sensitive regional banks, as well as the rate sensitive utilities and real estate sectors, are likely to continue to underperform. For additional details, we made additional enhancements to our asset and sector allocation process at the end of the note. In this week&rsquo;s note, our primary focus is Vice Chair Jefferson&rsquo;s discussion of easing cycles, we then offer a preview of next week&rsquo;s data and our updated asset and sector allocation outlook.

Wall Street analysts use complex models that take into account interest rates, economic growth, competitive advantages, management teams and historical profitability, among a host of other factors. If, as an investor, you want to assume most of the major factors remain stable, you can use trend analysis as a helpful tool. Using a longer term trend line or historical performance of the stock, you can aim to forecast a stock's annual rate of return. For Micron Technology, over the past 5 years, it's annualized stock performance is 16.19%, and if you assume that trend continues for another 5 years, you can expect a stock to trade at $192.05.

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is trading around the 507.52 mark. For those looking for growth, an initial move towards 508.34 is desirable. Should the market sustain above this level, the next target for buyers would be the 509.49 support level. A successful defense of 509.49 during the trading day could lead to an upward movement towards 510.14, with an ultimate bullish goal for SPY reaching 510.95. On the other hand, should the SPY fail to maintain support at 507.52, the market could see a downward shift towards 506.71 as bears take control. A confirmation of selling pressure at this level could lead to further declines towards 506.06. A break below this could reveal a significant support at 505.32, with a potential drop to the bearish target of 503.95 in a strong sell-off scenario. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ)&nbsp;index is navigating around the pivotal 437.47 level. Bullish investors aim to sustain this level as support, eyeing an advance towards 438.89. Holding above 438.89 could signal strong buying interest, potentially elevating the index to the 440.00 mark. An optimistic market could see QQQ testing the high target of 440.78. Conversely, if the index struggles to stay above 437.47, bears might gain momentum, pushing prices down to 436.58. A further decline in buying interest could lead to a test of 435.88. Persistent selling might challenge the support at 434.76, with a bearish outlook targeting a fall to 433.64. Apple Inc. Apple s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is presently fluctuating around the 182.27 level. Bulls are hopeful for the stock to uphold this level, with an eye on climbing towards 182.96. A continued bullish trend could extend gains to 183.38, with an ambitious target set at 184.09 for the day. Should Apple s shares fail to find footing at 182.27, a move lower to 181.25 could be imminent. Further bearish momentum could drive the stock towards 180.60, with a breach here possibly leading to a test of 180.10. A significant downturn could see Apple reaching the bearish end-day target of 179.36. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft&nbsp;(NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently positioned around 411.72. Bulls aim to solidify this as a base, seeking an ascent to 413.14. A firm hold above this level could signal a bullish trend, aiming for 414.56. Strong buying could propel Microsoft to the day s high target of 416.32. If Microsoft cannot maintain the 411.72 level, a downturn towards 410.64 is likely. A failure to hold this could see the stock descending to 409.69. Persistent bearish pressure might push Microsoft to 408.46, with a deeper fall to 407.11 as the bearish extreme for the day. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading near the critical 799.10 mark. Bulls are looking to drive the price towards 804.61, aiming to establish it as a new support level. Success here could lead to further gains, targeting 810.13. A strong buying trend could propel NVIDIA to a peak of 816.95, with an ultimate bullish goal of 827.98. Conversely, if NVIDIA cannot sustain support at 799.10, a pullback to 794.94 might be in the offing. A breach of this level could signal a deeper correction to 791.44. Weakness in the market could lead to a test of 787.68, with a severe sell-off potentially pushing NVIDIA to the bearish target of 785.35. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares are oscillating around the 143.77 level. The bullish scenario involves holding this level, with aspirations to ascend to 144.72. A continuation of the upward trend could see the stock reaching a high target of 145.94. If Alphabet cannot secure support at 143.77, a descent to 143.17 could be on the horizon. A break below this level could initiate a test of 142.53. Intense selling pressure might drive the stock down to the bearish target of 141.71 for the day. Meta Platforms Inc Meta Platforms&nbsp;(NASDAQ:META) is currently hovering around 483.11. Bulls are eyeing this level as a base, with the next target set at 485.96. A strong buying presence could further elevate the stock to 488.81, with an optimistic end-of-day target of 492.33. Should Meta fail to uphold the 483.11 level, a downside movement to 480.96 could be expected. Continued selling could bring the stock down to 479.47, with a significant downturn potentially leading to the day s bearish target of 477.50. Tesla Inc. Tesla&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) is presently trading near 191.52. Bulls are aiming for an upward push to 193.81, with further gains potentially leading to 195.91. A bullish market sentiment could see Tesla challenging the high target of 197.50, with an ultimate bullish goal of 200.43. If Tesla s support at 191.52 gives way, a decline to 189.22 may follow. Persistent selling could see the stock testing 186.10, with a significant bearish move potentially driving Tesla down to the day s low target of 184.10. Final Word: Today s market session is relatively calm with limited data releases. The focus will be on two key Treasury auctions: the 2 Year Note Auction and the 5 Year Note Auction, scheduled for 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM, respectively.

This shift away from tech investments unfolded both before and after Nvidia Corp. s (NASDAQ:NVDA) last earnings announcement. Hedge fund managers began to take profit from the sector s rally. This sell-off was particularly notable on Thursday, immediately following Nvidia s earnings announcement. The scale of this exodus is significant. Goldman Sachs  prime brokerage data revealed that the intensity of the selling spree landed in the 98th percentile compared to the past five years. See Also: AT&amp;T Offers $5 Credit for Nationwide Outage, Commits to 2024 Objectives Amid FCC Investigation There was also a spike in retail trading activity. Nvidia reached the 99.96th percentile in terms of average notional traded over the week, according to Goldman s prime brokerage data. Sustainability Concerns Arise: Goldman Sachs  Peter Callahan expressed concerns over the sustainability of this momentum. Despite the initial positive reactions to tech earnings, recent trading patterns and the performance of major tech firms post-earnings have introduced a sense of caution regarding future momentum, Callahan noted.  Despite the good vibes last week, activity levels have started to show some more 2-way action to it,  he wrote. Significant drops in stock prices for companies like Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOK), MercadoLibre Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), and Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) indicate a market that is reassessing the value and growth prospects of tech stocks.  In turn, this has raised some tension about the sustainability of momentum from here,  he added, signaling growing concerns over the market s future direction. Macroeconomic Indicators: The market s attention is now shifting towards a slew of economic indicators and the anticipation of interest rate adjustments. As tech earnings season concludes, Callahan anticipates a shift in focus toward macroeconomic indicators. This includes the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, Super Tuesday events, Nonfarm Payrolls (NFPs), and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the next 20 days. This transition occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic warmth, characterized by 10-year Treasury yields approaching year-to-date highs of approximately 4.3%, well above the 100-day moving average. Furthermore, expectations for interest rate cuts are being recalibrated as inflation came in hotter-than-expected last month.

What To Know: Several chip stocks have moved higher on continued upward momentum in recent sessions following better-than-expected financial results and strong guidance from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). On the conference call following the company's quarterly results, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company has been unable to keep up with demand in the short term and noted that current conditions are excellent for continued growth. The Nvidia CEO also said accelerated computing and generative AI have hit a tipping point of surging demand across the globe. Arm shares have been trending higher since the company reported its own quarterly results earlier this month. Arm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom line and issued strong guidance. The company said it had room to increase prices on some of its product offerings and noted that it planned to expand into new markets due to AI demand. SoftBank acquired Arm in 2016 for $32 billion and took the company public last year in what was the biggest IPO of 2023. Softbank still owns approximately 90% of the chip designer's outstanding shares. Next month, Arm's 180-day post-IPO lockup is set to expire.

The new facility, situated in Kumamoto, boasts a 45,000-square-meter cleanroom essential for semiconductor production, with operations slated to begin by the end of 2024.&nbsp; Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc (JASM), a TSMC-majority-owned entity, commenced the plant s construction in April 2022, supported by the Japanese government, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, and Denso Corporation.&nbsp; This collaboration aims to revitalize Japan s semiconductor sector, which is lagging behind global leaders TSMC and Samsung by a decade. Additionally, TSMC, along with Sony Semiconductor Solutions, Toyota, and Denso, recently committed to further investments in JASM for a second fabrication plant, set to begin construction by year-end and operational by the end of 2027. This expansion, expected to generate over 3,400 high-tech jobs and backed by a total investment exceeding $20 billion from the Japanese government, will produce chips for automotive, industrial, consumer, and high-performance computing needs. Japan committed up to ¥45 billion ($300 million) to support the Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC), a collective of Japanese researchers in developing advanced chip technologies.&nbsp; TSMC is also advancing its international footprint with a $40 billion investment in Arizona, establishing two manufacturing plants to fulfill U.S. demand.

Ahead of some key economic data scheduled for the latter part of the week, traders may lack the incentive to further propel stocks higher. However, the upward momentum, particularly in AI-leveraged stocks, could help cushion any potential market downturn. Global cues are negative, with both Asian and European stocks mostly retreating on Monday. Last Week s Market Performance: U.S. stocks concluded the holiday-shortened week ending Feb. 23 on a positive note, buoyed by Nvidia Corp. s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stellar earnings, which reinforced hopes of continued strong corporate profit growth serving as an upside catalyst for the market. The Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P 500 Index closed the week at fresh record highs, while the Nasdaq Composite briefly surpassed the 16,000 mark for the first time since Nov. 19, 2021, on Thursday before retreating below that level. If the uptrend resumes, the tech-heavy index could test its all-time high of 16,057.44 reached on Nov. 19, 2021. Small-cap stocks underperformed amid volatility triggered by earnings releases from these companies. Reflecting on the week s movements, fund manager Louis Navellier commented,  It s been a strong week and a strong month. Following a good earnings season, it s difficult to see, besides some profit-taking, what will push us off this positive trend.

In the aftermath of stock markets making new highs in America, Europe, and Japan, I expect that the overall stock market will get more narrow and selective as we digest stunning gains,  the fund manager said.  There is no doubt that 2024 is shaping up to be the best year since 1999, so we have a lot to look forward to due to easy year-over-year comparisons for the next two quarters, multiple Fed rate cuts commencing no later than June, and the optimism that occurs during a Presidential election year.  Quincy Krosby, Chief Global Strategist at LPL Financial, said the market breadth still remains as question and he also noted that historically February and March could be difficult periods for markets, particularly during election years.  With financial markets assiduously   and nervously   following data that could shift the probability towards earlier rate cuts, the inflation report from the PCE s perspective &nbsp;on Thursday morning is the main event, followed by a host of Fed commentary on Thursday afternoon and Friday,  he said.

What Happened: The  Magnificent Seven  stocks, which include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), have seen their fortunes diverge this year, reported Business Insider. Mike O Rourke, the chief market strategist at Jones Trading, who is credited with coining the term, suggested in a note titled  R.I.P the Magnificent Seven Era  that the group s dominance over the stock market is waning. The Magnificent Seven, which contributed to 88% of the year-to-date gains in April, now accounts for 45% of the S&amp;P 500 s gains, a significant drop.  This big rising tide of seven names lift[ing] all boats in the stock market, is what I see ending,  O Rourke said.  I don t see these seven names rising together.  O Rourke highlighted the diverging trajectories of the Magnificent Seven, with companies like Nvidia experiencing a 66% surge in stock value, while Tesla s stock has dropped 22% amid concerns about electric vehicle demand. See Also: Trump-Inspired MAGA Coin Skyrockets 20% To Outshine Dogecoin, Shiba Inu After Ex-President Softens Bitcoin Stance One of the key reasons for the divergence is the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in the market. Companies like Nvidia and Meta are seen as major players in the AI trade, while others like Tesla are still primarily associated with their core businesses. Dan Niles of the Satori Fund suggested reducing the portfolio to include only Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft, also known as the  Fantastic Four.  Why It Matters: The Magnificent Seven stocks have been a significant force in the market, as highlighted by Goldman Sachs  Hedge Fund Trend Monitor, which showed that six out of the 10 largest holdings in over 700 aggregated hedge fund portfolios are increasingly concentrated towards these stocks. This enthusiasm does not mirror their market weight, with the Magnificent Seven accounting for a record 13% of the aggregate hedge fund long portfolios, significantly underweight compared to a 26% collective stake in the Russell 3000. The Magnificent Seven stocks have also been a central topic during the recent earnings season, with Jim Cramer commending Nvidia for its record revenue and Amazon for its growing advertising and web services sector. Meanwhile, Broadcom has emerged as a potential replacement for Tesla in the Magnificent Seven, with its shares rallying 10% as Tesla s shares slumped 22% into 2024.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) was the stock of the year in 2023, and the upward momentum continued in 2024, as the first wave of the artificial intelligence revolution gained ground. CNBC s Mad Money host Jim Cramer is among the ardent backers of the company and its CEO Jensen Huang. But did you know, sometime in late 2022, Cramer recommended selling the stock? The Sell Call: In a  Mad Money  episode on Sept. 19, 2022, Cramer said he was concerned about Nvidia, citing the Ethereum merger.  Ethereum s new merger means that you do not need graphics cards that has been an unintended consequence for Nvidia,  he said. Those using Nvidia s graphics card for mining would not need them anymore, the stock picker added back then, arguing that the company hadn t yet transitioned to AI, virtual reality and machine learning.  So, we got the high-tech stuff, not there yet   and we have the lower stuff being hurt by this Ethereum transfer,  Cramer said. Still, Cramer has been a longtime backer of Nvidia, even naming his dog after the stock in 2017. Following Nvidia s blowout quarter this month, the CNBC host went onto say that Huang was a bigger visionary than Tesla s Elon Musk.

The Bitcoin mining craze that gained ground at that time triggered strong demand for the company s GPUs, which in turn boosted its sales. In 2018, when Bitcoin crashed, Nvidia s fortunes suffered. The COVID-19 pandemic helped the company rebound strongly, as GPU sales spiked due to remote work, COVID-19 research and gaming demand. In 2022, the company had to navigate through an inclement economy and geopolitical tensions, and, consequently, its stock pulled back. The following year, the AI revolution set in motion by OpenAI s ChatGPT proved healthy for Nvidia, significantly increasing the demand for the latter s high-performance chips used to train AI applications. Recently, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates by a wide margin and issued upbeat guidance for the fiscal 2025 first quarter. Returns from Nvidia Investment: A $1,000 investment in Nvidia on Sept. 19, 2022 would have fetched 7.5 shares of the company. The same 7.5 shares are worth $5,894 now (based on Nvidia s closing price of $788.17 on Friday). This would mean a return of about 490% in about a 17-month period. Source: Benzinga Pro On Friday, Nvidia hit a $2 trillion market cap, although it ended the session just shy of the mark. With the AI frenzy currently in a nascent stage, it may be a matter of time before Nvidia rises up in the ranks to become the most valued company. Wedbush's Daniel Ives said in a note Monday, ""Jensen and Nvidia have essentially cracked the code and sparked a generational tech transformation that investors are trying to get their arms around."" Yet, doubters point to a potential AI bubble burst and competition as headwinds for the company. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster said in a post on X he expects the AI wave to remain alive and kicking at least for the next three to five years.

This surge is part of a broader Big Tech rally that has captivated investors worldwide. Despite the bullish trend, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers&nbsp;voiced concerns at the FII Priority summit on Thursday in Miami, suggesting that the market may be&nbsp;overlooking potential political and social upheavals. Summers, in conversation with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, warned of a future marked by uncertainty and the possibility of disorder and chaos. He believes these risks are not adequately reflected in the current market valuations. Highlighting the rise of populist policies that encourage protectionism and restrict free movement, Summers pointed out these as &quot;very real risks&quot; that the markets seem to be underestimating. &quot;The world is potentially headed into a period where there is less of a sense of what the order is going to be and therefore more risk of disorder, chaos, and associated suffering,&quot; Summers said.&nbsp; Also Read:&nbsp;Larry Summers On Economic Resilience Amid Fed Tightening:  Interest Rates Well Above 3% Through The Rest Of This Decade  &quot;I m not sure that kind of risk is fully priced into markets,&quot; he added. His comments echo the sentiments of other financial leaders who have also expressed concerns over the geopolitical landscape s impact on the economy. Figures like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.&nbsp;CEO Jamie Dimon, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, and BlackRock s Larry Fink have all noted the economic and financial implications of ongoing conflicts such as those in Ukraine and Gaza. With the world facing unprecedented geopolitical tension, the consensus among these leaders suggests a cautious approach to the seemingly unstoppable market rally, hinting at the need for investors to consider the broader implications of current global events.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) is riding the AI wave, making it the undisputed leader in this industry. What Happened: Despite dominating the AI industry with a 70% market share, Nvidia CEO Huang told Wired in an interview that the competition is intense and everyone from big tech giants like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, to smaller players in China. He was then asked   Who do you see as your biggest competitor? Who keeps you up at night?    They all do,  Huang replied. He recognized several entities including Google s TPU team, AWS Trainium and Inferentia teams, Microsoft s internal ASIC development called Maia, and various cloud service providers in China. He also mentioned a number of startups and existing semiconductor companies.

He further added that what truly motivates him is the commitment to Nvidia s promise of being the only company that everyone can partner with to build AI supercomputers at data-center scale and the full stack. Why It Matters: Nvidia is on track to become the first semiconductor firm with a $2 trillion valuation. The company s market capitalization briefly crossed that mark as the stock began trading on Friday. The CEO s confidence in Nvidia s position in the market is not unfounded. In a conference call with analysts, he predicted that every enterprise on the planet will eventually run on Nvidia s  Operating System for AI . This optimism stems from the company s $1 billion annualized revenue run rate in its software and services segment. Furthermore, Nvidia s CEO has been recognized as a leading figure in the AI revolution. In December, Wedbush s Dan Ives lauded him as a  torch bearer  of the AI revolution, alongside Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Bezos, through his firm Explore Investments LLC, has committed $100 million. Microsoft is investing $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon.com Inc.-affiliated (NASDAQ:AMZN) fund are each providing $50 million.

That is the most ever recorded. The AI chipmaker is now the 4th largest company in the world, sitting just behind Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: 2222) and just ahead of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Thursday s bump came after the most recent earnings call; the company once again beat expected revenue and earnings per share. The numbers it is forecasting for the next quarter are also higher than many analysts expected. Since the AI craze began in early 2023, Nvidia&rsquo;s stock has risen well over 350%. The company is a primary piece in manufacturing the chips that power AI servers and has enjoyed the mantle of the go-to AI stock. Cathie&rsquo;s View Why then does Cathie Wood hold no NVIDIA in the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK)? Well, she did. Then, in January of 2023, at the inflection point of NVIDIA&rsquo;s meteoric rise, she sold the last of her shares. Essentially, Wood believes NVIDIA to be overvalued and prefers, as is part of her philosophy, to invest in smaller AI stocks with what she sees as having more to grow. Wood has described Nvidia as &ldquo;easy,&rdquo; &ldquo;really expensive&rdquo; and &ldquo;very obvious&rdquo;. After the sale, Wood said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just pivoting to another set of plays that most people have not discovered yet. Much like they did not understand that Nvidia was an AI play, really, until very recently.&rdquo; Wood prefers companies like UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) and Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO).&nbsp; Max View&nbsp; Traders bullish on Wood and her fund can buy the ETF directly or for those who want to further maximize their view, leveraged funds can help. For example, the award-winning AXS 2X Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:TARK) aims to return twice the daily return of ARKK.&nbsp; And for traders not buying what Wood is selling, AXS offers an option for the bears. The AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (NASDAQ:SARK), which aims to return the inverse performance of ARKK, can be an attractive option. TARK was just awarded Best ETF Launch at Benzinga&rsquo;s 2023 Fintech Awards. The innovative fund was launched in May of 2022 and the care and skill with which the fund is operated is clear.

Wood saw a potential growth industry in AI for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earlier than many. The bad news for Wood and investors in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) is the popular ETF sold out of its position too early and missed the current huge increase in price for Nvidia shares. What Happened: Over the years, Wood has been known to hold stocks and call for five-to-10-year outlooks instead of short-term trading. Artificial intelligence has been a big idea from the fund management company in recent years. The Ark Innovation ETF invested in Nvidia on several occasions before selling out of its position completely in January 2023 after selling a large portion beginning in November 2022. Today, those original shares would be worth significantly more than when sold. Wood recalled investing in Nvidia early during an interview on Benzinga's ""The Raz Report."" Wood said Ark Invest was ""there"" when Nvidia was in the early growth stages and mentioned a brainstorming session that led to buying shares in 2014 back at a price point of around $5. Selling winners isn't new for Wood and she shared that sometimes it's smart to take profits. ""If we see one of our stocks up 20, 30, 50, 100, 200% in a short period of time, we will take profits,"" Wood said. After selling the complete position of Nvidia in the flagship ETF, Wood said the company's valuation was ""very high."" ""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock,"" Wood told CNBC at the time. Wood said the flagship fun had consolidated to its highest conviction names at the time, including analyzing valuation of stocks. In November 2022, the Ark Innovation ETF held 772,884 shares of Nvidia according to data from CathiesArk. The fund sold a sizable chunk of Nvidia shares from this fund and several other Ark ETFs on Nov. 9. For the purpose of this exercise, let s use 772,884 shares as a starting point and use a price point of $142.11, which was the intraday high on Nov. 9, 2022. The shares held on Nov. 9 would have been worth $109,834,545.20 at the time based on these prices. Ark sold all the shares from the flagship fund between November and January. Today, the same 772,884 shares would be worth $616,676,414.76. This means Ark Invest may have missed out on potential profits of $506.8 million by selling the Nvidia shares early. Keep in mind this is only the Nvidia shares in the Ark Innovation ETF and also doesn't account for shares of Nvidia that were previously bought in 2014 and previously sold.

Ackman&#39;s fund ranks 7th, PANW faces strategy shift.","Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed exceptional earnings and outlook bolstered by its expanding AI division, significantly surpassing market predictions. The chipmaker's shares soared about 20% in the two sessions following the earnings announcement on Feb. 21, propelling Nvidia s market capitalization beyond the $1.9 trillion mark. This remarkable ascent in Nvidia's stock value propelled the broader stock market to unprecedented levels, with the S&amp;P 500 index breaking the 5,100-point barrier and the Nasdaq 100 index surpassing the 18,000-point threshold. Nvidia Rally Winners Amid Nvidia s record-breaking performance, particularly in AI, several stocks and ETFs were positioned to benefit. Notable mentions included C3.ai (NASDAQ:AI), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and specific ETFs with exposure to Nvidia and related tech sectors. AI Factories  Future Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, predicted  AI factories  would revolutionize industries globally by transforming data into valuable outputs, like those generated by AI chatbots. Nvidia s advancements, particularly in AI chips where it holds a 70% market share, position the company at the forefront of this industrial shift. Fed s Inflation Strategy The Federal Reserve s recent minutes revealed a cautious approach toward rate cuts, emphasizing vigilance against inflation. They expressed concerns over premature policy easing, highlighting commercial real estate vulnerabilities. The focus remained on achieving a sustainable 2% inflation target, with policy adjustments to be data-driven. Sanctions Expansion Impact The U.S. marked the second anniversary of Russia s invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on over 500 Russian entities. Targeting the military-industrial complex and third-country companies aiding Russia s war efforts, this move was part of a broader strategy to apply economic pressure in response to the conflict and associated human rights violations. Ackman s Profitable Year In 2023, Bill Ackman s Pershing Square realized $610 million, ranking seventh among top hedge fund managers. Focusing on just eight stocks, his fund achieved a 26.7% return, led by significant gains from Chipotle and other large-cap stocks. Palo Alto s Strategy Shift Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was navigating a tricky phase due to a strategic pivot, resulting in uneven financials and reduced forecasts, raising concerns about future earnings. However, some analysts remained optimistic about its long-term growth and market position. Musk Slams Lucid Elon Musk expressed skepticism about the viability of electric vehicle manufacturers Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). Citing Lucid s reliance on funding from Saudi Arabia s Public Investment Fund and suggesting a potential bankruptcy for Rivian within six quarters, Musk pointed out the challenges of achieving volume production with positive cash flow in the EV sector.

Renewed AI Frenzy Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of&nbsp;SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&amp;P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market hit a new high. The new stock market high has been triggered by renewed AI frenzy after NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings.&nbsp;The value of NVDA stock surged by a record $277B in one day. NVDA earnings sparked not only buying in the U.S. but also in stock markets across the globe. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market has room to run up. The chart shows a gap up on volume that was not heavy.&nbsp;This indicates lack of conviction. The AI frenzy is overshadowing all of the negatives.&nbsp;The two major negatives are the following: Interest rates are likely to stay higher for longer. Outside of AI, Wall Street&rsquo;s earnings estimates are too high. In The Arora Report analysis, the probability is only about 30% of a Fed rate cut in May.&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning in the early trade, the stock market is calm after yesterday&rsquo;s rip roaring rally on NVDA earnings. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. &nbsp;Please scroll down to see the protection band. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVDA.

Bitcoin We wrote in yesterday&rsquo;s Morning Capsule: There is speculation that bitcoin may see some selling as investors sell bitcoin to buy NVDA. This is exactly what is happening today as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing some selling. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp;The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp;If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Nvidia Corp. s (NASDAQ:NVDA) market-capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark, right out of the gates as the stock began trading on Friday. New Kid On $2T Club: Nvidia opened Friday s session at $809.70, up 2.87% from the previous session s closing price. With the Santa Clara, California-based company s outstanding shares at 2.49 billion, Friday s opening price meant the company s valuation shot up to $2.016 trillion. Nvidia joined an elite list of global corporations that currently boast a $2 trillion market cap. It is only fourth in the list after Microsoft ($3.07 trillion), Apple ($2.83 trillion and Middle East oil giant Saudi Aramco ($2.065 trillion). The rally in Nvidia shares started as early as 2023 after a lackluster performance in 2022. It rose 240% in 2023 and has added 58.6% year-to-date (based on Thursday s closing price). The strong two-day rally in the stock came after the company reported forecast-beating fourth-quarter results, thanks to strong Data Center revenue. The company is enjoying a near monopoly position in the market for AI accelerators and its high-performance chips such as the H100 are selling like hot cakes. See Also: How To Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Nvidia s Early Gaming Bet &amp; Growth: Nvidia was founded in April 1993 by the trio of&nbsp;Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem&nbsp;on the premise that PCs would one day become consumer devices for enjoying games and multimedia. The first product rolled out of Nvidia s stable in 1995 in the form of a PCI card named NV1, which incidentally did not sell well. The company forged an important manufacturing partnership with&nbsp;Taiwan Semiconductor in 1998. The real breakthrough came in 1991 when Nvidia invented the GPU. In 2001, the company unveiled its nForce Platform, signaling its entry into the integrated GPU market. It introduced the first programmable GPU, the GeForce3. On the financial front, Nvidia achieved the milestone of $1 billion in annual revenue&nbsp;in 2001. The stock was added to the S&amp;P 500 Index that year. In 2005, Nvidia developed a processor for&nbsp;Sony s PlayStation 3. The $1-billion number become Nvidia s run rate for quarterly revenue&nbsp;in 2007. When it comes to Nvidia s stock, the company went public in 1999, offering 3.5 million shares at $12 per share, raising $42 million in the process. The stock closed the debut session Jan. 22, 1999 at $19.70, giving it a market-cap of $626.1 million. Nvidia s Journey to $1 Trillion Market Cap: The chipmaker touched a $1 trillion market cap in mid-June 2023 amid the AI frenzy and since then it has held the $1 trillion+ valuation. It has taken the company just eight months to add another $1 trillion to its market cap. From its IPO, the journey to the first $1 trillion mark spanned exactly 25 years. With AI frenzy currently in its nascent stages, it may just be a matter of time before Nvidia rises up in the ranks to become the most valued company. Wedbush s Daniel Ives said in a note Monday,  Jensen and Nvidia have essentially cracked the code and sparked a generational tech transformation that investors are trying to get their arms around.  But doubters point to potential AI bubble burst and competition as headwinds for the company. Deepwater Asset Management s Gene Munster said in a post on X he expects the AI wave to remain alive and kicking at least for the next three to five years. At last check, Nvidia pulled back below $800 and traded at $794, up 1.1%, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Moreover, it could even challenge the AI chip leader someday in the future.","It&rsquo;s a well-known fact that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is much more than an EV company. Moreover, it could even challenge the AI chip leader someday in the future. Despite its mind-blowing results, even the leadership of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is threatened by the fact its clients such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are running to make AI semiconductors in-house. The EV king, Tesla Inc is also among those who flexed its innovative muscle to make its customized A.I. chips in-house. Last year, Elon Musk stated that Tesla plans to spend $2 billion to build its A.I. supercomputer. Moreover, Morgan Stanley stated in September that with its new supercomputing power, Tesla could position itself as a strong rival even to Nvidia. Even the automotive accessory creator Worksport tapped into the semiconductor expertise. Earlier in February, Worksport revealed its partnership with Infineon Technologies (OTC:IFFNNF), a global designer and manufacturer of semiconductors and semiconductor-based solutions specialized in automotive and industrial end markets. Through this collaboration, Worksport aims to reduce the cost and weight of its portable power stations. By using Infineon&rsquo;s GAN power semiconductors, Worksport will be able to boost the efficiency while lowering the weight, size and cost of its power converters used in its COR portable battery system. More precisely, Infineon&rsquo;s technology will empower Worksport to lower the&nbsp;weight of its battery system by 33%&nbsp;and reduce system costs by up to 25%. While finalizing the COR battery system, Worksport is also preparing its power pal, the SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover.&nbsp;The power-on-go duo promises to enhance the range of electric pickup and provide off-grid power. Today, Worksport also revealed its&nbsp;new distribution partner, Canada&rsquo;s leading wholesaler of aftermarket truck products, Dix Performance North. Dix Performance North covers all major car and truck brands, including automotive giants like Ford Motor (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), Hyundai Motor Company (OTC:HYMTF), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), and from now on, it will also include Worksport&rsquo;s covers. Earlier this week, Worksport also revealed a version of its SOLIS solar cover will be available for the Ford F-150 Lightning. Although the electric version of its iconic pickup didn&rsquo;t succeed to awaken the luster of its internal-combustion-engine counterpart, Worksport&rsquo;s solar-powered tonneau cover could help Ford&nbsp;boost its appeal. Ford has been struggling on the EV front and scaling back its EV ambitions, but it has no doubt that EVs are here to stay so it definitely needs all the help it can get. Through Infineon that is banking in the AI boom, Worksport gained access to powerful breakthroughs on this revolutionary front.&nbsp;&nbsp; Infineon Technologies is heavily betting on the AI boom to boost their chip sales. Infineon CEO&nbsp;Jochen Hanebeck stated today that the company is positioned to&nbsp;generate billions in revenue and grow by selling higher price chips. For the 2024 fiscal year, Infineon expects to generate revenues in the low three-digit million euros range, while guiding for annual revenues of around one billion euros in a matter of few years. However, although Infineon posted record results for the 2022/2023 fiscal year, it also scaled back its targets for 2023/2024 due to a weakening macroeconomic outlook. But, despite its lowered guidance, the potential for lucrative semiconductor sales is undoubtedly there as both tech and EV companies need them.

Now, let s dive into the stock analysis: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust The SPY&nbsp;(NYSE:SPY) is currently trading around our focal point of 507.52. For those looking on the optimistic side, we re aiming for an initial climb to 508.34. Should the market maintain its momentum above this mark, we anticipate a move towards our intermediate target at 509.49. Holding above 509.49 during the trading session could signal a further ascent to 510.14, with our ultimate bullish objective for the day being 510.95. Conversely, if the SPY struggles to maintain 507.52 as a base, we foresee a downward test to 506.71. Presence of sellers at this juncture could drive the price further down to 506.06. Breaching this level under significant selling pressure might bring into play a more substantial floor at 505.32, with the most pessimistic scenario for the day setting our bearish benchmark at 503.95. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), also known as the Q s, is hovering around a crucial juncture at 437.47. Bullish participants are encouraged by stability above this level, eyeing 438.89 as the next milestone. A firm establishment of support here could pave the way to 440.00, with a strong market potentially testing 440.78. The highest ambition for bulls today is to reach 440.78. If the Q s falter below 437.47, we anticipate bearish momentum to push the price towards 436.58. Any signs of frailty here might lead to a further dip to 435.88. Persistent selling could challenge the resilience at 434.76, with a breakdown here setting the stage for our deepest bearish target at 433.64. Apple Inc. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading near our specified level of 183.38. Bullish scenarios hinge on maintaining this as a supportive base, with ambitions to elevate the price to 184.09. A sustained bullish drive could extend to 184.59, with the day s bullish climax potentially reaching 185.86. Should Apple s support at 183.38 give way, we anticipate a descent to 182.96. Continued bearish pressure could see the price sliding to 182.27, with a significant sell-off possibly breaching the 181.25 threshold. The ultimate bearish target for the day is set at 180.60. Microsoft Corp. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is positioned around our benchmark of 413.14. Optimists are looking for the price to stay buoyant above this level, aiming for a rally to 414.56. A secure position here could signal a bullish trend towards 416.32, with the day s peak bull goal at 417.25. On the flip side, if Microsoft cannot sustain support at 413.14, we expect a bearish exploration towards 411.72. Breaking through this floor could lead to further declines to 410.64, with sustained bearish momentum potentially driving the price to 409.69. The lowest bearish expectation for the day is at 408.46. NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) is navigating around the pivotal point of 799.10. Bulls are eyeing an upward movement to 804.61, hoping to secure this level as a firm foundation. Success here could spur a rally to 810.13, with continued bullish sentiment possibly reaching 816.95. The top bullish target for NVIDIA today is set at 827.98. If NVIDIA fails to hold 799.10 as a support, we re braced for a dip to 794.94. A breach of this level, underlined by seller dominance, could lead to a fall to 791.44. A weaker market might necessitate a reevaluation at 787.68, with the most bearish outlook for the day pegging the target at 785.35. Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet&nbsp;(NASDAQ:GOOGL) finds itself around the mark of 143.17. Bullish forces are rallying for a push beyond this level to 144.72. Maintaining momentum could lead to a test of 145.94, marking the highest bullish aspiration for the day. Conversely, if Alphabet cannot secure 143.17 as a foundation, the path opens for a downward move to 142.53. Failing to hold this level could see a further decline to 141.71, with a pronounced sell-off potentially pushing the price to the day s most bearish target at 141.12. Meta Platforms Inc Meta&nbsp;(NASDAQ:META) is currently positioned at 485.96. Bulls are aiming to uphold this level as a baseline, with sights set on an advance to 488.81. A robust buying wave could elevate the price to 492.33, with the ultimate bullish target for the day being 495.54. Should Meta s support at 485.96 erode, we anticipate a descent to 483.11. Persistent bearish activity could extend the downturn to 480.96, with a significant breach here possibly leading to our most bearish endpoint of the day at 479.47. Tesla Inc. Tesla&nbsp;(NASDAQ:TSLA) is trading near the critical level of 195.91. Bullish scenarios revolve around pushing the price to 197.50, with further buying potentially leading to 200.43. A strong bullish market could challenge 204.33, with the day s highest bullish target being 206.71. If Tesla cannot maintain 195.91 as a supportive threshold, we re prepared for a test to 193.81. Increased selling could bring 191.52 into focus, with a break below this level setting the bearish objective for the day at 189.22. Final Word: Today s trading session lacks significant US economic data. Market movements as we conclude this shorter trading week will likely be influenced by the expiration of weekly option flows. Key stocks to monitor for institutional positioning include NVIDIA and Meta. Wishing everyone a successful and fruitful Friday.

Investors are constantly on the hunt for undervalued, under-followed and emerging stocks. With countless methods available to retail traders, the challenge often lies in sifting through the abundance to&nbsp;uncover new information. This index layers editorial commentary to help make sense of why these stocks should be of interest and whether investors or casual readers should watch them. Here is a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week of&nbsp;Feb.&nbsp;23: Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA): The credit card company saw increased interest from investors likely related to the $35 billion takeover of Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) announced by Capital One Financial Corp (NYSE:COF). The acquisition could cause headwinds for Mastercard and Visa Inc (NYSE:V), which are leaders in the credit card market. Capital One uses Visa and Mastercard for its credit cards and recently renewed partnerships. After the partnerships end, Capital One could transition to Discover and away from Visa and Mastercard. Visa shares also saw increased interest from Benzinga readers according to proprietary data. Related Link: Why Capital One-Discover Merger Is A Threat To Visa, Mastercard: Creation Of New Credit Card Giant Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU): The apparel company joins the index with increased interest from readers likely due to a ratings update from Needham. The Buy rating and the price target of $525 were reiterated by Needham and come in ahead of the recent price of $455 and the 52-week high of $516.39. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter financial results in March. In the third quarter, Lululemon beat Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. The company said it was pleased with the early performance of the holiday season in the fourth quarter. Shares of the apparel company are up over 40% in the past year, but remain down around 11% year-to-date in 2024. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI): The technology company is carried over from last week s Stock Whisper Index. Super Micro Computer is one of the fastest-gaining stocks in recent weeks and shares are up over 1,000% in the past year. Analysts have been sharing increased price targets as the stock continues higher. After a pullback from highs, Super Micro shares saw a +33% gain on Thursday, likely due to peer company NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings and seeing shares up. Super Micro recently announced that it is expanding its portfolio of AI solutions. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE): The content creation company saw shares fall early in the week potentially related to ChatGPT parent OpenAI releasing teaser trailers for is text-to-video tool Sora. The release of Sora expands the artificial intelligence capabilities that users of OpenAI can have at their fingertips. Several Adobe products are used by people to create images and videos and the new OpenAI tools may see users move over to the rival. Adobe reports first-quarter financial results in mid-March and may be asked for more details on the potential competition by analysts. Short S&amp;P 500 ETFs: When looking at the proprietary data used to construct the Stock Whisper Index, ETFs also show up many times with increased interest from readers. ETFs are generally left off the index unless something big jumps out, which is the case this week with two (Benzinga is giving you a bonus Stock Whisper pick this week) S&amp;P 500 inverse ETFs seeing elevated interest. The ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P 500 (NYSE:SDS) and ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (NYSE:SH) inverse ETFs both saw increased interest. The funds seek to offer performance that is the inverse of the S&amp;P 500 index or in the case of the UltraShort ETF, two times the performance of the S&amp;P 500. Increased interest in the inverse S&amp;P 500 indexes comes as the index and the tracking ETFs like the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) hit record highs and the index passed the 5,000 milestone. Benzinga previously shared that the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks has made up a large portion of the S&amp;P 500 Index gains and the performance of the index is widely outpacing S&amp;P 500 ETFs that are equally weighted. Investors may think that a pullback in the S&amp;P 500 is coming given the increased interest in inverse ETFs.

Q4 revenue of $22.1B, EPS $5.16. H100 in high demand, new chips coming.","In 2023,&nbsp;Nvidia Corp&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) revolutionized the artificial intelligence (AI) and computing industries with the release of its H100 data center chip, contributing over $1 trillion to the company s value and solidifying its position as a leader in AI technology.&nbsp; This week, Nvidia reported&nbsp;fourth-quarter revenue&nbsp;of $22.10 billion, higher by 265% year-over-year, above the Street consensus of $20.62 billion. The adjusted EPS of $5.16 beat the Street estimate of $4.64. The H100 chip, four times faster than its predecessor, the A100, in training large language models (LLMs) and 30 times faster in responding to user prompts, has seen such high demand that customers face up to six-month wait times, Bloomberg&nbsp;reports. Nvidia s dominance in the AI accelerator market is uncontested, holding about 80% of the market share.&nbsp; The company is preparing to introduce the H100 s successor, the H200, and plans for the more advanced B100 model, continuing to drive the AI technology frontier forward.&nbsp; CEO Jensen Huang revealed that Nvidia is also introducing two new AI chips explicitly designed for the Chinese market. Huang mentioned that these chips are currently being sampled by customers and comply with U.S. regulations without requiring special licenses. Reports indicate that Nvidia plans to launch three chips—H20, L20, and L2—in China. These chips retain Nvidia s advanced AI features but have reduced computing power to align with U.S. export control measures, Reuters reports. Nvidia has already begun pre-orders for the H20 chip, which faces a delay in its release due to integration challenges encountered by server manufacturers.&nbsp; For the fiscal fourth quarter ending January 28, Nvidia s sales in China, including Hong Kong, dropped to $1.9 billion, accounting for about 9% of its total sales—a sharp decline from 22% in the previous quarter. &nbsp; Nvidia stock has gained over 63% year-to-date.&nbsp;Advanced Micro Devices, Inc&nbsp;(NASDAQ:AMD), the next most significant AI beneficiary, has gained over 31%.

What Happened: Nvidia s fourth-quarter earnings report, released on Wednesday, showed a significant increase in chip demand for AI projects. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which includes Nvidia among other tech giants, also saw a substantial increase, rising over 4% and experiencing a record daily volume of 280,000 shares traded, CNBC reported. David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments, said, ""We remain confident that these names, even absent Tesla's recent underperformance, are reflective of the Magnificent 7.  UBS global wealth management CIO for the Americas, Solita Marcelli, believes that despite a 24% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, there is still potential for further growth in tech stocks, especially those tied to the AI revolution.

The fund s success has continued in 2024, with $99 million in inflows pushing its total assets over $140 million. Despite concerns about the market s concentration in a few large stocks, the Roundhill ETF s success suggests that investors are still eager to buy into the Magnificent Seven. Why It Matters: The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF reportedly offers equal-weight exposure to the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. The surge in demand for the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF follows Nvidia s impressive earnings report. However, this surge may not be without its risks. Short-seller Jim Chanos recently highlighted a potential risk regarding Nvidia s reliance on the other Magnificent 7 companies, suggesting that most of Nvidia s operating cash flow could be capex from other Mag 7 darlings. This dependency could pose a risk to the sustainability of Nvidia s growth. Despite these concerns, analysts are still bullish on Nvidia s future, especially in the AI sector. The company s strong performance in its fourth quarter financial results has been attributed to robust supply and demand dynamics, with analysts anticipating a significant upside in the shares.

Max Lin, executive vice president at CTBC Bank, Taiwan s biggest private bank, noted the burgeoning demand for banking services in Kumamoto, driven by the key&nbsp;Nvidia Corp&nbsp;(NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier s announcement of its first-ever Japanese chip fabrication plant in the region.&nbsp; It marked a significant pivot for CTBC Bank, which expanded its operations to downtown Kumamoto to cater to the growing needs of clients involved in the semiconductor boom, from real estate inquiries to lifestyle advice, Nikkei Asia&nbsp;reports. Recent reports indicated that TSMC is expanding in Japan with a second factory&nbsp;for 6-nm chips. The new facility in Kumamoto prefecture will likely be operational by the end of 2027. The semiconductor industry s expansion has turned Japan into an attractive destination for foreign banking expansions, a notable shift given the country s previous challenges with negative interest rates deterring such moves.&nbsp; This change is underscored by the entry of seven other Taiwanese banks into Japan, following TSMC s lead.&nbsp; TSMC s Kumamoto plant, poised for mass production by year-end to supply giants like&nbsp;Sony Group Corp&nbsp;(NYSE:SONY) and&nbsp;Denso Corp&nbsp;(OTC:DNZOF) (OTC:DNZOY), represents TSMC s broader strategy to diversify its manufacturing footprint outside Taiwan in response to geopolitical tensions and the global chip shortage, with ambitious plans for overseas expansion in the U.S., Japan, and Germany.

The social media user speculated that the Nvidia customer contributing 19% to total revenue, procuring chips directly and indirectly, might be Meta Platforms. He estimated that $13.2 billion of Nvidia s total revenue could have come from Meta, approximately 48.5% of the Mark Zuckerberg-led company s total 2023 capex of $27.2 billion.  Are we seriously projecting that Meta will continue to spend 48% of their total capex on GPUs? I press x to doubt,  he added.

He anticipates the stock to trade above $1,000, perhaps within a year or two.  But when I think about those price targets, I think it is important to quickly step back and think about Nvidia s business before you get quickly carried away,  Munster said.

See Also: Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Boom-Bust Business: Munster said these boom-and-bust businesses have had a scarring effect on investors over the past five years.  But my view forward is that those price targets are probably going to ultimately, the $1,000+, prove to be conservative because AI is that big of a deal,  he said. Drawing a data point from the earnings call, Munster noted that Inference is consuming 40% of the GPU usage, not  hyper-scalers  building their infrastructure and waiting on business to come through. Nvidia is going to benefit tremendously from the increasing AI adoption, he said. Sell-side analysts and investors see an inevitable correction could come in 2026, with analysts seeing 20% growth in 2025 followed by a down year in 2026. But Munster differed with the view.  I don t think the bust is going to come in 26,  he said. The AI frenzy could last until there is going to be bust and that probably is three to five years from now, he added.  The bust is going to be epic when it happens. But I think there is plenty of room for upside until we get there,  Munster said.

What Happened: ARK s flagship fund hasn t&nbsp;held Nvidia shares since early&nbsp;2023, despite Wood s belief in the potential of disruptive technologies. This decision has resulted in ARKK missing out on Nvidia s stellar performance, with the fund down nearly 8% this year, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, Wood s smaller ETFs have recently reduced their already limited investments in the company led by Jensen Huang. Nvidia recently reported impressive earnings, adding&nbsp;$256 billion in market value&nbsp;in one trading day. The company s stock has risen 57% in 2024, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100, which&nbsp;are each up about 6%.

Wood, in 2023, characterized Nvidia as ""easy,"" ""really expensive,"" and ""very obvious,"" stating a preference for less-talked-about companies such as UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) and Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO). Why It Matters: The AI revolution has been a key focus for Wood. The Ark CEO last year suggested that Artificial General Intelligence will likely give a strong lift to economic growth, from the 3-5% year-over-year rate currently to as much as 30-50% per year. In 2023, she stressed the importance of investing in less obvious AI plays, such as UiPath Inc. and Twilio Inc. Ark Invest's decision to sell Nvidia shares captures attention, especially considering the company's recent financial achievements and the bullish outlook provided by several analysts. Nvidia in the fourth quarter surpassed revenue expectations and provided strong guidance for the first quarter, signaling continued growth in the AI sector. Additionally, Wood picked Tesla Inc. over Nvidia as the top AI player for the next five years, a decision that seems to have contributed to ARK s current position.

What Happened: Nvidia, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, recognized Huawei as a top competitor in various categories, including AI chips, Reuters reported on Friday. The filing highlights Huawei s involvement in supplying AI chips such as graphics processing units, central processing units, and networking chips. The Chinese tech giant has also been identified as a cloud service provider, developing its hardware and software to enhance AI computing. This acknowledgment comes amidst the ongoing chip constraints, which have led Huawei to shift its focus towards AI.

What Happened: On Thursday, Schiff shared via X, formerly Twitter, that Nvidia s stock price hit an all-time high following an earnings report that exceeded predictions. This surge added $277 billion to the company s market capitalization.
